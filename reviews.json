I have reached out to customer service for assistance but have not heard back. I don‚Äôt anticipate they will respond or help me fix it so I am now looking for a different app to use to help me focus. Thanks for nothing, Pomodoro Timer."

Which helps prevent doom scrolling and distractions that are on your device, if you choose to use an app that is not on the list will result in the death of your tree. I know it‚Äôs not a real tree but it does help with the negative reinforcement feeling that I need to stay focused. I‚Äôm in college also so need help blocking off my study times. I do also still use an pomodoro timer bc I need an added visual aid, but using both together has been a game changer in my everyday life. Would totally recommend this app to a friend."

As someone who used to struggle with attention and often felt frustrated for not ‚Äúgiving my all,‚Äù Forest helped me turn my perfectionism into a healthy motivation.\n\nThe ability to ‚Äúplant trees‚Äù that grow based on how long I stay focused pushes me to beat my own record every day, and that has boosted my productivity like nothing else. Now I can maintain long study sessions (7 to 8 hours or more in a day) with steady focus that used to feel impossible.\n\nPlus, seeing my progress visually reflected in a growing forest gives me a real, tangible sense of achievement. Forest has helped me not only study faster but also process and digest information better, moving past the anxiety of immediate perfection to focus on steady progress.\n\nFor anyone struggling with concentration or motivation, Forest isn‚Äôt just an app‚Äîit‚Äôs a companion that helps you reprogram your mind and build habits that actually work.\n\nSuggestions: I would love to see a widget for iPhone standby mode to make tracking even easier. Also, giving users more opportunities to earn or buy trees would be awesome‚Äîbecause who wouldn‚Äôt want a bigger, greener forest?"

        "content": "The concept behind these focus apps is to hijack our brain‚Äôs reward systems to be productive rather than distracting. You get dopamine from focusing and getting a tree planted. But when the ‚Äúreward‚Äù (planting a tree, unlocking trees, etc) becomes the goal in itself, then the app becomes a distraction in itself.  The first time I stopped using this app, I stopped because I had become obsessed with growing a beautiful forest. I notice there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúpay-to-play‚Äù that takes advantage of this misdirected reward system, where you can pay to get more coins or diamonds to get more rewards. It would be good if these options were not so visible on the app and could be turned off and only accessible in the settings. This takes advantage of our brain‚Äôs reward systems for the developers‚Äô profit rather than helping us direct it towards becoming productive."

I love this app but it would be so much more fun and fulfilling to use if it had a feature that allowed you to visualize the focus time you give to certain categories. For me, I use a specific type of tree for each project im working on,etc. so that when I look at my garden I can kind of visualize where my energy is going. It would be amazing if the app incorporated one of those matching puzzle type of game elements to grow a larger tree by combining trees of a certain type. I think it would be really fun to be able to earn 3 small trees then combine those into a bigger tree, then earn 3 of those and make an even bigger tree, you get the idea. It would be more visually appealing to see the trees with more drastic size differences too. Also i think there‚Äôs a nice metaphorical reminder in there that the plant you water most will grow the tallest. Please consider adding these features !"

I added a widget to my Home Screen that shows my forest everyday, as well as how many minutes I‚Äôve studied. It‚Äôs a huge motivation to sit down and focus for even just a short time everyday to see some trees on the Home Screen page. I feel proud at the end of the day/week/month looking back at my lush forest. Also, thank you also for adding the challenges! I usually finish them pretty quickly but they help me to start my month off right, and I can ride the momentum even after I‚Äôve completed the challenge.

        "content": "I‚Äôve been a long time user of the app forest for around 4 years now when I bought the app. I feel as if the core of the app really does improve focus through creating good habits. However when I was made aware of the paid subscription update as well as the addition of AI I was very upset. I believe there are 4 big problems with these changes. 1). AI is bad for the environment and and for an app that prides itself on its environmental impacts it seems like implementing ai is just a way to be ‚Äútrendy‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt follow the apps core values. On the website forest states ‚ÄúAt Forest, we believe that better selves build a better world.‚Äù Building a better world does not include implementing AI when it is unnecessary and unhelpful. 2). Forest is a very simple app that works to break your phone addiction so adding all these bits and bobs are not helpful/useful and most of the time annoying. 3). Forest is already very buggy. For being around for years I feel as if there are big bugs that should be worked on instead of rolling out new features that no one asked for or wanted. 4). My final complaint is that I already spent the money to buy the app and asking its users to now pay for a subscription model is just another money grab. If I am asked to buy the subscription I will be switching to another app. \nOnce again forest used to be my favorite focus app but now seeing the changes coming I fear I may need to choose another option that values its users."

My only criticism is the bugs that are in the app. There are times when the app just freezes on me. I will click on the plant button and nothing will happen but when I refresh and reopen the app, it shows as though the trees died even though I didn‚Äôt do anything. When I go to edit my app restrictions list, sometimes it will just pull up a blank white screen. This has been an issue that has persisted for a while now. I have restarted my phone and everything.

If users could start focus sessions without using their phones, they would look at their phones less. Which is the whole point of using the app. But that feature isn‚Äôt available. Instead, all you can do is look at your forest.\n\nOther annoyances are some questionable UI choices, like the annoying pop up on the view Forest screen that can‚Äôt be turned off. \n\nBalanced against this is the clever tree planting system which gives users a stake in completing through on their focus sessions. Also valuable are the statistics, competitions, and ability to acquire more flora through sweat equity. These features make Forest one of the best pomodor apps. It‚Äôs just unfortunate to miss on something as basic and useful as Apple Watch support."

It‚Äôs enticing me to want to use the app every single day even when I may not need to focus. I love that it gives you crystals if you do a particularly hard challenge, which are otherwise locked behind a paywall.

I love how in December it turns to a winter theme, but you do have the option to turn that off. I like being able to choose between stopwatch and timer because sometimes I don‚Äôt know how long I want to work for but I don‚Äôt want to kill my tree if I need to work for less than I set the timer for. I also think it is great you can customize your allow list. I also love being able to look at your forest as days, weeks, months, or years. It is interesting going back to see what I was focusing on, what months I focus the most, and even what years I was most focused. I have never had a problem with this app! I think it would be cool if different seasons and holidays get decorations like December does. For example, spider webs and bats for October or sparkles and hearts for Valentine‚Äôs Day.

It‚Äôs motivating to want to keep the little trees and plants alive, and it‚Äôs always fun to change to a different type of plant or flower. \n\nThe best part (and most motivating thing to me) is working to plant a real tree. Knowing that my focus time can actually be spent on something that makes the real world better really encourages me to keep pushing. \n\nI would recommend Forest to anyone and everyone."

It‚Äôs my favorite Pomodoro app. The one (kind of big) criticism I have is that there is no way to select which variation of a tree species you grow. It‚Äôs better for me to set my day into smaller chunks of focus time, but that means I never get to see the other variations of trees available when setting the timer to 60‚Äì120+ minutes. It‚Äôs really disappointing; it takes kind of a long time to save enough coins for them, only to never/rarely get to grow anything past the ‚Äúyoung‚Äù, less robust tree."

It would be great if a break timer would start automatically when a focus session is completed and to have the ability to set different length breaks based on how many sessions have been completed. However, the usability of the app needs to be fixed ASAP. I can‚Äôt use the app now. It either crashes when I open it, opens but is frozen, or doesn‚Äôt start a session but still kills a tree. It is a little frustrating that the app all of a sudden stopped working and that I have to use coins to remove planting records that I didn‚Äôt even fail."
