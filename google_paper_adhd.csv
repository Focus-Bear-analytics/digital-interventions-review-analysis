FLIP - Focus Timer for Study,,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kr.co.rinasoft.yktime&hl=en&gl=us,measures study time when flipping phone over; tracks and visualises study time; also sets challenges; tries to schedule tasks (e.g. 'practice grammar') in empty spots in calendar,Self-tracking,Goal-advancement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,Google Play,"Amazing!! I love this app!! I have ADHD and this really helps when I study to motivate me to get a good 'focus score'. It has a premium, but even without it I have been able to see my study progress, set goals, and use the community feature. Only thing I don't really like it the abundance of that community feature. It's just a bit much but if you like studying with friends go for it. Definitely recommend."

I like the minimalist app design. I feel that the Start/End session could be improved upon. It lacks an effective visual cue at the end of a session. For completed focus sessions, a count-up timer for additional focus time would be helpful (e.g. missed ""End Session"" notif / locked in). These would be game-changers for reducing distractions."

I 
use this app to help manage my ADHD. I also use alarms throughout the day. 
The problem is that when I've locked myself out of my phone, I can't 
dismiss these alarms!! So they go off for 30 minutes before my phone 
automatically dismisses it. I would also like a feature that shows how much 
time you've used, either as a widget or displayed on the lock screen."

I have ADHD, so i use the schedule options to help me stay on task and on time getting out the door and then build in deep work sessions manually throughout the day. I rarely try to end a session early, feeling that kinda defeats my purposes for the app for in the first place, but the few times I did, I didn't encounter issues. It's definitely one of my go-to tools for adhd focus and productivity support!"

Auto enable focus time. Auto warnings when we should stop playing on the phone when we should sleep (no sleep schedule) No tracking tasks Vs what I'm actually doing (playing on ticktock) These functions are important for anything having a difficult time to organise themselves."

I have tried many, but this one is the best. It provides gentle reminders that are effective and not irritating. The result is that I am more present, more productive, I read more, and I sleep better. Thanks SPACE! Edit: I do wish that there was an option for more screen unlocks. As someone with ADHD I unlock my phone 4 or 5 times for one task."
