Name: Baby Bubbles Babble

So, as a first birthday present for her, I developed Baby Bubbles Free. The first 100% free bubble popping game for babies and toddlers that also has NO ADS and NO INTERFACE. Just plain, simple, happy bubble popping fun.

## Improvements

Improvements for increasing number of apps scraped:
* Consider modifying scraping algorithm to scrape apps from the 'You Might Also Like' section when an app is found by a particular keyword 
* Explore 'appium' for more robust scraping

## Notes:
* Python app store scraper does not work (py_google_play_instruction.md)
* Scraping from actual Apple App Store gave null data (may be result of Apple's privacy laws etc)
