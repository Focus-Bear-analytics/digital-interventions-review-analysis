This is summary what have done and some improvement needed to be done in this google store branch.

What Have Done
survivorship analysis result:
Total 60 apps from apple app store, 43 dead apps and 17 alive apps.
Total 96 apps from apple app store, 68 dead apps and 28 alive apps. 
Total 224 apps from chrome extension, 224 alive extensions.
result stores in alive_app.csv.


What Have Done need some improvement.
Filter review comments contains "ADHD" from the apps(google play store) output of the paper.
result stores 8 apps in google_paper_adhd.csv.
Something can be improved:
The usage of sort function in filtering reviews, I use Sort.Newest as the standard to sort the newest reviews. So use other can get different results.

google-play scraper possible improvement:
The search function can only return 30 outputs, similar function can be used for each one to find more related apps.
When filter the reviews, I use the Sort.Newest as the above one, so same improvement can applied as well.
