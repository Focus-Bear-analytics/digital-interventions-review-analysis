Plantie - Stay focused,1135988868,Best Study App,5,"Plantie has saved my study life, as someone with undiagnosed ADHD, I struggle to focus on studying, and find it quite hard to not grab my phone and scroll endlessly. Plantie motivates me. The second I start my timer, my phone is off limits. I love the fact that if you stop the timer you don‚Äôt get coins, it would be too easy if you did. I really hope this app gets more trees, I‚Äôm working though buying them all and I‚Äôll feel so sad once I‚Äôve purchased every tree.  Things I‚Äôd love to see:  - More Trees  - An option to remove ads that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt involve getting double coins, I want the adds gone but I enjoy the coin rate as it is (makes it harder)  - To see the fruits on the tree during the study timer, not the break (I don‚Äôt use the break option, and if I do I am out of the app. I‚Äôd love to see the cute apples and oranges etc on the tree)  - Bonus to the last one, this one is a lot as it would go into the programming side of things, but it would be cool to see either the tree grow through the timer or the fruits grow. Maybe depending on how long you‚Äôve set it for, eg, a 1 hour session (60mins) could be 6 apples on the tree, and maybe if it‚Äôs a 2 hour study, once the 1st hour goes, the apples fall and the next 6 start to grow)",Review,
Block & Flow: Stay focused,1018884302,I have the attention span of a cockroach.,5,This app is life changing! I can study easily for 25 minutes and now I end up doing 10+ blocks a day.  Amazing resource for people with ADHD as well.,Review,
one sec | screen time + focus,1532875441,Neurodivergent,3,"Looked really helpful, but as someone with ADHD, the fact that I have to memorise the steps and manually setup the automations was just an immediate huge hurdle that my ADHD brain immediately wanted to run away from. Too overwhelming",Review,
"Routine Planner, Habit Tracker",1450486923,The motivation I needed,5,Helps motivate me to stay on track and recognise how much time tasks actually take. Used it with my ADHD son this morning and we had a spare 15 mins to play a game together before school and weren‚Äôt stressed getting out of the door ü•∞ That‚Äôs priceless!,Review,
Habio: Habit Tracker & Planner,1517360968,Rip off,1,The auto subscription charged me over $100. This is on top of the $14 for the trial. They do not send out reminders of when an auto subscription is due. They are taking advantage of people with ADHD who struggle with executive function.  Also the app is slow and not user friendly. Do not download! It‚Äôs a rip off,Review,
Habio: Habit Tracker & Planner,1517360968,SCAM,1,"DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS! And beware of the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù an absolute scam of an app that once in - good luck getting out. Not connected to Apple subscriptions, to unsubscribe they make you jump through hoops and their service response takes weeks. They have a laundry list of ways you can request a refund which is a SCAM SCAM SCAM RUN AWAY. The app is also so detailed requiring a lot of input and navigates not so clearly, that in hindsight anyone with ADHD/ADD would not benefit from this setup. Feels ai created and managed. Highly do not recommend.",Review,
Shmoody: Mood & Habit Tracker,1534196157,Scam,1,"I have ADHD and this obviously came up in my FYP as advertised to help. I signed up for their trial but it never worked from the beginning. Only a black screen. I totally forgot about it I didn‚Äôt cancel in time and was charged the full amount at the end. I reached out to their support but never received a reply and it‚Äôs really not worth my time and energy to fight it. All in all, this was a very expensive lesson. I think it‚Äôs predatory to target neurodivergent people, pretending to be a great app and using this subscription tactic.",Review,
