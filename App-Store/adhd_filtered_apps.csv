Plantie - Stay focused,1135988868,Best Study App,5,"Plantie has saved my study life, as someone with undiagnosed ADHD, I struggle to focus on studying, and find it quite hard to not grab my phone and scroll endlessly. Plantie motivates me. The second I start my timer, my phone is off limits. I love the fact that if you stop the timer you don’t get coins, it would be too easy if you did. I really hope this app gets more trees, I’m working though buying them all and I’ll feel so sad once I’ve purchased every tree.  Things I’d love to see:  - More Trees  - An option to remove ads that’s doesn’t involve getting double coins, I want the adds gone but I enjoy the coin rate as it is (makes it harder)  - To see the fruits on the tree during the study timer, not the break (I don’t use the break option, and if I do I am out of the app. I’d love to see the cute apples and oranges etc on the tree)  - Bonus to the last one, this one is a lot as it would go into the programming side of things, but it would be cool to see either the tree grow through the timer or the fruits grow. Maybe depending on how long you’ve set it for, eg, a 1 hour session (60mins) could be 6 apples on the tree, and maybe if it’s a 2 hour study, once the 1st hour goes, the apples fall and the next 6 start to grow)",Review,Plantie is a time management app that allows you to grow and harvest your favorite fruits while stay focused on your work.  Features:  - Grow your favorite fruit while focusing on your task  - Task will be interrupted if user switch to other apps  - Keep track of your performance everyday  - Collect badges and keep motivated  - Unlock more fruits along the way,https://apps.apple.com/au/app/plantie-stay-focused/id1135988868?uo=4

Amazing resource for people with ADHD as well.,Review,"Do more in less time with 25-minute blocks. Take it one block at a time and surprise yourself with how much you can accomplish.   Inspired by tried and trusted time management techniques. Block & Flow is simple, beautiful and will get your productivity flowing.   FEATURES: - A 25-minute visual countdown keeps you focussed and avoiding distractions. - Manage your energy levels with regular breaks - Measure your day, week and longer by how many blocks you finish.  - Colour code a block for the activities that you do often or care particularly about.  - Goals enable you to be intentional with your time. - History gives you an understanding of where your time goes.  - A block’s duration can be changed to your ideal time.  WHY IT WORKS: - It makes it easy to get the day started. Just do your first block. - Creates an enjoyment and satisfaction as you see all that you get done. See your blocks build up one by one.  - It is clear when to stop. Stop when your block has finished, or after you have done x many blocks for the day. - Every block that you finish is a small success. As these small successes build-up, your self- belief grows.  - If you keep finishing your blocks. The time will add up to a lot and you will surprise yourself.  (We under-estimate what we can do in the long term).   WHO IS IT FOR? People tell me that they do x many blocks a day, or over a week which is fantastic. A few people have been completing their blocks for a year and more.  I imagine someone completing their blocks over a month, a year and ultimately many years. I believe they will grow as a person, stretch themselves, and be surprised with what they are able to learn, create and accomplish. This is what excites me and motivates me to do my best for someone that chooses Block & Flow.   What will you accomplish, one block at a time?

one sec | screen time + focus,1532875441,Neurodivergent,3,"Looked really helpful, but as someone with ADHD, the fact that I have to memorise the steps and manually setup the automations was just an immediate huge hurdle that my ADHD brain immediately wanted to run away from. Too overwhelming",Both,"In contrast to Screen Time, one sec delays access to apps and websites instead of blocking them completely – this is fundamentally different than any other screen time tool you’ve tried before!  Have you tried a digital detox? And it did not work, because you fall back into your habits immediately?   Well here is the solution:  one sec solves our unhealthy phone relationship at its roots: by making distracting apps less appealing, our brains lose interest to open them all the time without proper intention.  The effectiveness of one sec has been confirmed in a peer-reviewed scientific study with the Max-Planck Institute and Heidelberg University: app usage drops by 57% on average! Long-term!  Fight the social media algorithms and win back control over your phone usage & your subconsciousness!  “one sec” uses Shortcuts Automation to toggle a deep breath animation whenever you open one of the configured apps (Instagram, Twitter, YouTube…). This breaks unconcious social media habits short-term (literally, as soon as you have set it up) and even helps long-term by adding more friction when opening these apps.  Did you really want to open Instagram? Or was it just because you're bored waiting for your bus? This app helps you to reflect your actions, thoughts, and feelings; disrupting harmful social media habits with mindfulness.  On top of that, “one sec” also contributes your mindful moments to the Health App via HealthKit.  Especially for people with ADHD one sec is a great tool to gain back control for incredible focus and concentration.  Integrations and collabs: - You can set up one sec to sync tasks with Structured, so you won't be able to access social media apps during ongoing unfinished tasks. - You can set up one sec to learn a new language with LENGO, so every time you open social media, you have to answer a handful of vocabularies.

Shmoody: Mood & Habit Tracker,1534196157,Scam,1,"I have ADHD and this obviously came up in my FYP as advertised to help. I signed up for their trial but it never worked from the beginning. Only a black screen. I totally forgot about it I didn’t cancel in time and was charged the full amount at the end. I reached out to their support but never received a reply and it’s really not worth my time and energy to fight it. All in all, this was a very expensive lesson. I think it’s predatory to target neurodivergent people, pretending to be a great app and using this subscription tactic.",Review,"Shmoody: Your Personalized Wellness Companion  Shmoody is your all-in-one self-care and personal growth toolkit, designed to help you navigate tough moments and build uplifting habits over time.
