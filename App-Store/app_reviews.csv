Tap 2 Distract,6447653942,Best App Ever,5,"I might be a little biased, but this could be one of the best apps out there that provides anywhere, anytime distraction. The team have worked hard to make this a reality to assist kids with needle phobias, or anybody dealing with stress or anxiety. We hope this app helps people find a some calmness and ‚Äòme‚Äô time when they need it the most."
Tap 2 Distract,6447653942,Therapeutic,5,"Just downloaded this app and couldn‚Äôt be happier! Wish I only had this sooner, definitely recommend to all üòä"
Tap 2 Distract,6447653942,This app has been so helpful,5,The best for blood tests and needles! Recommend!
Baby Bubbles Babble,842788895,Perfect!,5,"Thanks so much for sorting out the state of bubble apps in the App Store! This is exactly what my son wants - bubbles! Just bubbles to pop!! Excellent work, would recommend!"
BlockSite: Block Apps & Focus,1474967653,meh,2,was good until the introduced all the paid options now it‚Äôs very hard to use also you literally can just change the restrictions so easily so it doesn‚Äôt do anything to stop you from hopping on
BlockSite: Block Apps & Focus,1474967653,Difficult to navigate,1,I found the app confusing and difficult to navigate. Having upgrade windows pop up begging for payment every time I tried to do something didn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôll delete and use an alternative
BlockSite: Block Apps & Focus,1474967653,Great application,5,Highly recommend
BlockSite: Block Apps & Focus,1474967653,Awesome,5,"Should an option for locking several apps by the organisation only, I can still again n again go back n come n unlock the app, which hinders the process should be definate."
BlockSite: Block Apps & Focus,1474967653,Useful,4,this app is useful though i wish I was able to block more sites/apps without having to upgrade
Plantie - Stay focused,1135988868,Best Study App,5,"Plantie has saved my study life, as someone with undiagnosed ADHD, I struggle to focus on studying, and find it quite hard to not grab my phone and scroll endlessly. Plantie motivates me. The second I start my timer, my phone is off limits. I love the fact that if you stop the timer you don‚Äôt get coins, it would be too easy if you did. I really hope this app gets more trees, I‚Äôm working though buying them all and I‚Äôll feel so sad once I‚Äôve purchased every tree.  Things I‚Äôd love to see:  - More Trees  - An option to remove ads that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt involve getting double coins, I want the adds gone but I enjoy the coin rate as it is (makes it harder)  - To see the fruits on the tree during the study timer, not the break (I don‚Äôt use the break option, and if I do I am out of the app. I‚Äôd love to see the cute apples and oranges etc on the tree)  - Bonus to the last one, this one is a lot as it would go into the programming side of things, but it would be cool to see either the tree grow through the timer or the fruits grow. Maybe depending on how long you‚Äôve set it for, eg, a 1 hour session (60mins) could be 6 apples on the tree, and maybe if it‚Äôs a 2 hour study, once the 1st hour goes, the apples fall and the next 6 start to grow)"
Plantie - Stay focused,1135988868,Awesome app,5,The app is great! I specifically love the background white noise as it helps me focus. The trees are also really pretty and the timer is‚Äôt distracting so I won‚Äôt stare at it.
Plantie - Stay focused,1135988868,BEST,5,I really like everything about the app. The graphics interaction everything. Only thing i found missing is a widget. Both for home and Lock Screen. Really need a widget especially during the standby mode during charging.  Thanks
Plantie - Stay focused,1135988868,needs more plants,5,Love this app but wish it had a few more plants to choose from and if there was a way to see all of the plants you have grown in a big garden.
Plantie - Stay focused,1135988868,Op,5,Op
HUDWAY Cast ‚Äî Safe Driving,1258579266,Useless app,1,"I bought the device years ago just after they released it. Connected the device by OBD, cannot ‚Äúcast to HUD‚Äù the navigation. I thought a firmware update might solve the problem but never had any notification for updates from this app. got no reply to my email sent about one and half years ago. I thought they gave up the business as I gave up the device. Surprisingly found they are still selling! Just sent another email asking for support, hopefully they have someone doing the job"
HUDWAY Cast ‚Äî Safe Driving,1258579266,Waste of money,1,"Contacted support but took ages to reply (4months). I chucked the device as it‚Äôs unusable anymore. Had only been using Hudway Cast for 7 months then it stopped performing as advertised. What a waste of money. Poor customer service, won‚Äôt purchase any product from this company. I won‚Äôt recommend."
HUDWAY Cast ‚Äî Safe Driving,1258579266,App crashes in 5 minutes,3,Great app if it was working. The HUDWAY cast loses connection within 5 minutes with the phone. Always require t stop vehicle to reset manually. Totally waste of time. You should make some changes on the app to keep the wireless connection with the phone

Cape: Screen Time Master,6444819615,Very good App.,5,This is a must install app for iOS.
Cape: Screen Time Master,6444819615,Not working,3,"Had this app for over a year now, was working great so i upgraded to premium. In the last week, the app doesnt hide my apps from home screen or app library, only stops me from accessing. I need it to fully block but it doesnt do that. Very disappointed"
Cape: Screen Time Master,6444819615,Amazing what an app can do,5,"Such a strong app to make sure you never get troubled with what you are holding on your phone. Complete mode for securing app removed them completely from sight, shortcuts as well as from App Library, making it pure and secure from pry eyes"
Cape: Screen Time Master,6444819615,IOS 7.5,1,App fails to hide/show apps under new IOS 7.5 upgrade.
Meditation Timer - Zenitizer,6444767911,Awesome App,5,It‚Äôs the app I‚Äôve been looking for! I really enjoy using it. Thanks for fixing the crashes on my watch in version 1.12.2.

Compose - Send email without distraction,947492678,I Love It,5,Thanks for creating this app. Have been looking for a send only email client. Would love a iPhone X UI update.
Screen Time Control,1665692026,Fix it,1,Hate the new update put it back I have no idea how to do it anymore
Screen Time Control,1665692026,Bring back the old version,1,I don‚Äôt even know how to work this update
Screen Time Control,1665692026,Bring back old one,1,It‚Äôs so bad now
Screen Time Control,1665692026,worst update,1,"i cant access the apps even if i delete the restriction, the old app was better. Please fix this"
Screen Time Control,1665692026,Bring back the old version üôèüò≠,3,Pls bring back the old version because it doesn‚Äôt work properly anymore!!! Thank you‚Ä¶
Brick - Ditch Distractions,6448794069,Easy to use & has really helped.,5,"I‚Äôve only had my Brick a few days but it‚Äôs already helped. I‚Äôve used it to lock myself out of social media, during the day, while I‚Äôm at home alone, working for myself. I Brick my phone & send the Brick off to work with my husband. I‚Äôm not missing social media & it‚Äôs made me really aware of how often I pick up my phone to distract from tasks I don‚Äôt like.   Being an international customer the only feedback I have is that while I received an email confirmation of my order, I never received notification that my order had shipped. It left me wondering, on the order status, & eventually I had to take time out to contact customer service. Knowing it was on its way in advance would have been helpful.   Thank you. I think it‚Äôs a great product & would recommend to others. Next step is to see if you have an affiliate program, because I‚Äôd like to offer it to my clients."
Brick - Ditch Distractions,6448794069,Highly reccomended,5,"I‚Äôve tried using Screen Time, Opal, etc. None of them really work, for a number of reasons. But Brick is working very well for me. The fact that I can turn it on anywhere but I can‚Äôt unlock it until I‚Äôm back at the brick itself is really great. It would be really good to have a timer (e.g. to automatically activate ‚Äòbrick mode‚Äô every morning at a certain time, AND/OR to be only able to unbrick for X minutes at a time). Hopefully these features will come soon. Keep it up!"
Brick - Ditch Distractions,6448794069,ALMOST perfect!,4,"Brick has already helped me reduce my screen time exponentially since it arrived 2 weeks ago! The added physical element to being able to use my blocked apps has been the key for me. Being so small and portable I‚Äôve put it somewhere incredibly inconvenient so now each time I want to access my bricked apps I need to get up, walk across the house and reach around stuff to scan Brick which is enough to deter me from doing just that! The added feature of being able to Brick my phone remotely has also made it so much easier to stay consistent! The cherry on top that would make this a 5/5 review would be adding an automation/timer feature. I‚Äôd love to be able set a timer so that when I unbrick my phone it will automatically Brick itself again after 15min (or however long I set) so that I don‚Äôt fall into the doomscrolling trap and forget to Brick my phone again.  Love what you guys have done, will definitely be recommending this to my friends!"
Brick - Ditch Distractions,6448794069,Need help,1,"Unboxed and app downloaded, app button doesn‚Äôt do anything and ready to scan pop up never appeared as per image. App had no help option so reaching out here and instagram."
Brick - Ditch Distractions,6448794069,So close to perfect,4,Love this app. Taking back my mornings and my productivity. Agree with other reviews that scheduled bricking would be even better! I understand the Brick team are working on this functionality. Can‚Äôt wait!
Virtual Hope Box,825099621,Very helpful,4,"Has good distracting things, games, ability to add photos, reminders, quotes. Will be recommending!"
Virtual Hope Box,825099621,Great app!,5,This is a great app! I was wondering though whether a password feature could be added to it? Particularly for the coping cards section? Thanks heaps for this well researched and thought out app. :)
Bubbles,284288607,Great for kids!,4,"It's perfect for little kids who need to be entertained whilst in the car. The best part is there are no pop ups, levels or options. Which means they can't accidentally buy more games, get into the App Store or get into the main menu on your phone and call people...or worse. Very well designed for little kids who always want to play"
Bubbles,284288607,Fireworks.....,2,Fireworks crashes the app! Have tried to restore several times .....
Bubbles,284288607,What happened!,1,"Used to love this app but now there's no bubbles, only ugly heads. Please go back to the bubbles!"
Bubbles,284288607,Superb!,5,"My 20 month old son loves this app! It's by far his favourite, and although very simple it keeps him enthralled. He asks for 'bubbles' whenever he sees the iPad (so I keep it hidden most of the time if I want him or I to be doing something else!). It's been wonderful while he's been sick and nothing else has seemed to keep him entertained. Thank you!"
Bubbles,284288607,Love it!,5,My youngest son loves this game! It's kept him quiet an entertained every time! :)
MyScreen: Screen Time & Focus,6737836744,Hard to use,2,"It looks good and I wanted to be productive so I downloaded the app, for some reason, it didn‚Äôt stop me from accessing my blocked apps, and everywhere I go I am given advertisements and a screen asking me about paying a subscription. The stimulation from the advertisements and the failure to block apps like YouTube seems to contradict the purpose of the app.  Overall I hope the reason for the trouble isn‚Äôt the app but me not knowing how to use it"
MyScreen: Screen Time & Focus,6737836744,Scam,1,This app literally posted a Ad of a different companies App: Opal (Great app I use) unlike the real Opal this fake gives you a PayWall don‚Äôt get this app get the real one Opal
MyScreen: Screen Time & Focus,6737836744,Most helpful app,5,This app literally keeps me on track with stuff and makes me focus more sharp
MyScreen: Screen Time & Focus,6737836744,100% AMAZING!!!,5,"Definitely recommend, there is nothing wrong with this app at all. At first I was suspicious about complete all 5 star ratings but I completely understand now. This app give you focus time that allows you to spend more family time, or unwind. The customizable app groups are amazing as they help you set times limits better than ever. Definitely recommend and is a must!!!"
Center Meditation Timer,1332483673,Simple and effective,5,"Simple gong sound to begin, end and at intervals of your choosing. Really appreciating using it. Can link to apple health app if you like too."
Center Meditation Timer,1332483673,Doesn‚Äôt work properly. Needs bug fixes.,1,Been using this app for a month and was loving it but now suddenly the app goes to sleep during the timer and the interval sounds don‚Äôt play. I‚Äôve tried changing the settings for screen sleep but it is set on disabled and it can‚Äôt actually be changed. Nothing happens when you try to tap that setting option.  Such a shame because I was using this daily snd getting a good routine and tracking all the data and now if I have to get a new app that works properly I will lose a month of my date. Needs some bug fixes.
Center Meditation Timer,1332483673,Ideal,5,As a Zen practitioner this is perfect . Just as it should be - simple. Start and finish.
Center Meditation Timer,1332483673,Very cool. Please enable logging on the watch app.,4,"Cool app, made my someone who gets it. Would love the watch app to log meditations. Thanks."
Center Meditation Timer,1332483673,Almost great,4,Would be 5/5 but the sleep screen setting doesn‚Äôt allow me to enable it.
Focus Lock: Block Apps & Focus,1494966346,THE WORST,1,The Worst app EVERR it used to work before and hide all my apps once I started my session that's why I decided to pay this time but now it doesn't work anymore took my money and keep loading when I start my session but never starts it. I TRIED EVERYTHING.
Focus Lock: Block Apps & Focus,1494966346,Ruined my phone,1,It‚Äôs permanently locked me out of my apps and I can‚Äôt fix it.
Focus Lock: Block Apps & Focus,1494966346,Great App !,4,Amazing app that‚Äôs super useful if u you are social media addict like me! App disappears and comes back after the time you have set! One thing I‚Äôd like mention though that others have already mentioned is that it would improve the app immensely if you could choose what apps to not disappear because some apps are actually used for productivity. This makes me refrain from using the app. Overall great app and great conceptü¶ã
Focus Lock: Block Apps & Focus,1494966346,Scary!! Beware of your privacy and data,1,"It‚Äôs surprisingly weird that this app must use internet while locked , also the device management that you have to add in order to approve device management it‚Äôs weird ,  I wonder if any information was leaked while using the app .   Lock the phone for 2 hours + lock internet, weird that after 2 hours didn‚Äôt work , almost 4 hours and didn‚Äôt work , have to force close the app in order to use my device   I wonder what background data was used while the phone was locked"
Focus Lock: Block Apps & Focus,1494966346,Changes order of apps on home screen,2,"This app is good however when you use it, it removes all apps from their previous folders when they appear again once the timer has finished.  It‚Äôs super frustrating as I order all my apps in to folders so they were easily accessible on the one page.  I don‚Äôt know if there is a way to stop this happening?"
Cleverest: Focus Digital Detox,964890124,"Simple, effective, preventative.",5,"I LOVE this app. It keeps me from reaching for my phone when I need to write, and it‚Äôs the ONLY thing I‚Äôve found so far that does."
Cleverest: Focus Digital Detox,964890124,It doesn‚Äôt work :(,2,"It doesn‚Äôt let me block my apps because it keeps saying that I need to mute my phone but my phone is already mute! Please fix this, it looks like such a promising app!"
Dumb Phone (dp),6504743503,Just the right app,5,I haven‚Äôt purchased an iOS app for a very long time but this one is definitely worth it! It‚Äôs a little dear but I appreciate that it‚Äôs made by an Aussie. Wish there were no limitations with iOS restricting direct access to certain system apps (understand this isn‚Äôt on the developer).
Dumb Phone (dp),6504743503,Easy to use,5,"This is such a great looking app, simple to use. Highly recommend if you want to touch your stupid phone less!"
Dumb Phone (dp),6504743503,Can‚Äôt imagine my phone without it now,5,"Can‚Äôt imagine my phone without this app now. It‚Äôs completely changed how I interact with my phone ‚Äî no more icon badges unless I choose to have them, and it‚Äôs really helped cut the dopamine loop that usually comes with constant notifications. I‚Äôm way less tempted to pick up my phone. Love it."
Dumb Phone (dp),6504743503,Don‚Äôt love it‚Ä¶,3,Not as good as I thought it might be. Also makes you realise how much you use apps practically in life for doing what you need to do! Banking apps etc.
Dumb Phone (dp),6504743503,Perfect! Exactly what I needed,5,"I love this app, I‚Äôm so much less distracted and it‚Äôs helped me reduce multitasking!!"
Spaces.,1509611686,Promising  app let down by usability.,2,Good looking app but in use for notes of any size it becomes so slow it is unusable.
Just Write - App For Writer,942826631,AWESOME!!,5,This app is perfect! It is supported on my iPhone 6s and it works very smoothly!
Just Write - App For Writer,942826631,Best app,5,This is the best app ever
Just Write - App For Writer,942826631,Confusing the first time I use it,1,How do u use this app it‚Äôs soo confusingü§®
Just Write - App For Writer,942826631,Saved stories,1,The most worst bit there could be is when you save a lot of work and can‚Äôt log back In. üò¨
Just Write - App For Writer,942826631,A nice little app,1,"I take back my word. This app had disappointed me, after I've saved a 4000 word document on it, and now it won't let me log back in. For every time I try, it crashes on me."
Jomo - Screen Time Blocker,1609960918,Changed my life,5,Not enough reviews for this app. Made by a woman so I bought it and gosh it SHOWS!! Very carefully thought out and just the best. Changed my life.  I put it on strict mode when im feeling good and when I have lack of self control it‚Äôs just the best . THANK YOU
Jomo - Screen Time Blocker,1609960918,The best app that I ever used.,5,"Works perfectly, it‚Äôs adjustable and price is more than reasonable. ‚úÖ"
Jomo - Screen Time Blocker,1609960918,Amazing!,5,"I adoreee this app. Jomo has reduced my screentime by 3-5 hours each day ü•π  It‚Äôs a huge number that I wasn‚Äôt able to achieve by willpower alone despite my best efforts for a couple of years.  I love how fun & functional the app is! The blocks are easy and intuitive to set, and pretty tricky to get around when the urge to scroll creeps back in.  The annual premium plan is well priced - paying $1 a week to regain 20-35 hours is a trade off I‚Äôm super pleased to make."
Jomo - Screen Time Blocker,1609960918,Amazing app!,5,"This app has actually improved my quality of life in a way I didn‚Äôt know I needed. Literally my screen time is down 59% in the first week, it has really changed my life so quickly. And it‚Äôs cheap too! Could not recommend more, thank you devs"
Jomo - Screen Time Blocker,1609960918,Great help,5,"Jomo is wonderful. It‚Äôs easy to use, effective and the team are  super helpful and responsive. Well worth a go!"
#blockit: Block distractions,1492879257,Exactly what I needed,5,"I‚Äôd like to say thanks for this app, it‚Äôs helped my productivity and wellbeing a lot already.  I had a question regarding one feature within the app where there was a small issue due to Instagram changing their layout.  I heard back from developer Jordi same day and the issue was fixed within 24 hours and I was notified to please update.   Great customer service and app, well done!"
#blockit: Block distractions,1492879257,Not amazing if you want to be able to post,2,"This would be so much better through the app instead of the website version as im wanting to limit my consumption but be able to post stories, reels and posts to my business still, thats not really possible through the website version so in this case this app is not super great for that"
#blockit: Block distractions,1492879257,Works like a charm,4,As somewho who is easily distracted by feeds on Youtube & reddit. It saved my productivity. I hope that the ability to disable feeds could extend to some other major sites like yahoo.co.jp or hk01.com.
#blockit: Block distractions,1492879257,The app stopped working and now it requires a subscription,3,"What exact functionality requires this app to have a subscription rather than a one time payment?  Update.  Thanks for the response. That's however was not my experience. For me, on my phone, the app that was previously working stopped working. Luckily I was quickly able to find a good alternative."
#blockit: Block distractions,1492879257,A fantastic app ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,5,"This app is fantastic and I recommend it to everyone that is wanting to limit their screen time. It has recently changed to subscription only but I believe it is worth it because you will not need any other app. Also, the developer seems to take on feedback to always improve the app! I hope in future we are able to block websites with a time limit so it isn‚Äôt tempting to make the block inactive."
Focus Dog: Productivity Timer,1179111193,DONUT DOG/ FOCUS DOG- Best app ever!,5,"Focus dog the app is literally one of the best apps ever!  It is so fun to play, I can beat my siblings, to see who can get more donuts and higher level. And I can also beat the focus app IQ, Patrick too!  The aim of the app is to spend less time on phone by getting donuts every 10 mins to feed to focus dog, then with the money, buying upgrades and even helping real dogs in need!  It keeps me motivated and spend way more time off my phone! My phone screen time came from 5-10 hours to only 1-2 hours, like that is literally crazy?!!?!! (BTW this is from a teen who uses the app)  The only thing I would say is to maybe add a screen blocker, where only that app, can be used but other than that it is the best app ever!!!!!!"
Focus Dog: Productivity Timer,1179111193,Love it and could be better,5,"I love the design and interface, I would like to have sub-tags under tag (e.g. Read and have a book name as sub tag so I don‚Äôt need to fill in the book name every time.) and archive the sub tag(once I finished the book, I can hide the book name and won‚Äôt appear when I choose the tag to start the timer)  I also want it can start a timer automatically once I open the apps and can automatically assign the tag, as well as having shortcuts or Apple Watch version so I can control the timer via my watch."
Focus Dog: Productivity Timer,1179111193,Love this app!,5,Would recommend for anyone who needs a little motivation to stay off the phone. I have purchased pro & it is worth it for the reminders to not switch screens ;)
Focus Dog: Productivity Timer,1179111193,Let‚Äôs me focus on what ever I want and is so cute,5,"I love this app , it‚Äôs theme brings me joy I have found no bugs so far and love to use it to study and monitor how much time I spend on technology."
Focus Dog: Productivity Timer,1179111193,helps me study,5,thanks focus dog
Block & Flow: Stay focused,1018884302,Blocked and flown,1,Zero stars!  This app needs to be removed as it no longer functions without a subscription.
Block & Flow: Stay focused,1018884302,Good but one suggestion,5,"Hey, I love the app, it works great and is nice to use. I just wanted to say that I want to purchase a pro membership but find the price too high. If the subscription was perhaps half the current cost I would not hesitate to purchase. If you reduce the price it may encourage more people to sign up. Thanks"
Block & Flow: Stay focused,1018884302,Great app,5,Really simple and easy to use - great for getting things started and keeping track of progress to stay motivated.
Block & Flow: Stay focused,1018884302,"Great app, too expensive",3,A great and easy to use app. It works great. Unfortunately after a trial you have to pay monthly or yearly to become a pro. The price is too high for just a timer app.
Block & Flow: Stay focused,1018884302,I have the attention span of a cockroach.,5,This app is life changing! I can study easily for 25 minutes and now I end up doing 10+ blocks a day.  Amazing resource for people with ADHD as well.
Fatty Cat! - Study Companion,1458862121,Love it but there could be improvements,4,"I love the kitty but i wish i could customise the break and study times by the number like 1hr study and 25 min break, i hope more designs come out because this app is super fun üêàüêà‚Äç‚¨õ"
Fatty Cat! - Study Companion,1458862121,Fatty kitty,5,This kitty is just so adorable.
Fatty Cat! - Study Companion,1458862121,My cat is fed!!,5,"Strangely I really enjoyed working (no study here, I run my own business!) and fat cat kept me focused on tasks.  I set my to-do list before me and got 4 jobs done, in my five minute breaks I did laundry & hung it out! Loving it. So simple and effective.  Thanks developers üíï"
Fatty Cat! - Study Companion,1458862121,Good studying timer,5,This app is amazing with how it was made and everything and I use it even when i'm not studying its overall just really fun and the premium is cheap
SocialFocus: Hide Distractions,1661093205,Finally a tool that works in every way it needs to.,5,Finally a tool that works in every way it needs to. Awesome that they added a grey feature to make socials grey and significantly less engaging. This tool puts you in control of what you want from social media.
SocialFocus: Hide Distractions,1661093205,So good fr,5,Love dis app
SocialFocus: Hide Distractions,1661093205,Control restoredüòÅ,5,Fantastic. So easy to set up. Blocked everything but my notification on Facebook website. Now I can just check what I need and don't see any sponsored content. I deleted the Facebook app and have the website open in a tab. No more Doom scrolling.
SocialFocus: Hide Distractions,1661093205,Customise every social media platform,5,Yes
SocialFocus: Hide Distractions,1661093205,Doesn‚Äôt work on the apps,2,"It does say it in the description that it‚Äôs the websites not the apps but I was so desperate to block reels on Instagram.  I hate that I need to keep the app for friends that use it the message but the reels are such a time suck. Wish this work for the apps, be warned I don‚Äôt know anyone that uses the websites on their phone, would be good for desktop I  guess"
Ochi: Block Websites & Apps,1603024803,good,4,very good!!
Ochi: Block Websites & Apps,1603024803,Great Concept & Excellent Execution.,5,"I've been waiting for an app like this for years. However, it's currently very unstable, crashes and freezes rendering the app unusable. I'm sure with coming updates this will all be sorted and it will develop into a great app.  UPDATE: With the latest update, this has been resolved and the experience has been flawless since then. The developer was quick to contact me on this issue and released a speedy update which has fixed this problem. 11/10"
on point | Minimal Home Screen,6476465213,Over an hour of my life I‚Äôll never get back,1,"I spent over an hour setting it up, paid for premium and then the developer released an upgrade that completely screwed up my set up and put me back to square 1.   All my widgets were empty and I couldn‚Äôt really use my phone until I went in a spent another hour fixing it.   It‚Äôs also pretty janky, and often launching an app just takes me to the Apple shortcuts app instead of the app I wanted.   Wish I could get my money back and feel a little scammed."

Soundscape: Sleep Focus Relax,6480119395,Perfection,5,"Just so good I love it, it‚Äôs free has everything I need to sleep good, good updates. The only downside is I wish there was a bit more security to blocking apps because I sometimes find myself just unblocking all apps and using them which greatly distracts my sleeping but beside that everything is so good"
Soundscape: Sleep Focus Relax,6480119395,Pretty good,3,"Good app but if I‚Äôm linking my Spotify account to it, I should be able to choose a playlist to listen to rather than only the listed playlists. Also I should be able to indefinitely lock app for a certain period and then not be able to change it until the time is finished because otherwise it is too easy to go into the app and just turn it off."

Addiction Solitaire‚Ä¢,1450542818,Good game but ads are annoying,3,The game is good to play however I deleted the game as I was absolutely sick of watching the ads - particularly as that same ad over and over again for Royal Match. There should be a limit to the number of times the same ad plays.  You can‚Äôt buy an adult free version of the game so I‚Äôve had enough of watching Royal Match so deleted this game.

I Am Sober,672904239,it‚Äôs good,4,"i like this app because it has helped me in the past with other problems, and it still does. it is effective and useful, keeps track of your progress and doesn‚Äôt shame you if you relapse as recovery is not linear. however, it would be nice if there were more changes as the app gets a bit repetitive. otherwise, this is a good app, and i recommend to anyone battling with any kind of addiction. x"

Pelago Health,1234288038,Awful tactics. Don‚Äôt download,1,"I find it extremely unethical that this app plays off a persons addictions to get an insane $40.00 per month for basic content. Don‚Äôt be fooled, you get barely anything for free on here. This isn‚Äôt an app that wants to help you, they‚Äôre taking advantage of those who a desperate. Disgusting tactics.

SPACE - Break phone addiction,916126783,"Data miner, do not use",1,"Notifications are frequent for an app aimed at minimising phone time.   Quiz was useless, as it didn‚Äôt get my usage type from its questions and didn‚Äôt have any indicator showing why one was more ‚Äòaccurate‚Äô than another.  The measurement is not accurate depending on the background process - and does not even give a breakdown of what apps contribute to the hours that it‚Äôs collecting.  Absolutely awful experience when using maps to navigate. It sent more notifications WHILE DRIVING.   The irony in this app. Immediate delete."
SPACE - Break phone addiction,916126783,Great app to help me,5,I love SPACE. In just a few days it has helped me to realise how much time I spend on my phone and ways to get control back.
SPACE - Break phone addiction,916126783,Overall good but would like more info,3,It's good to get an idea of how many times each day I've unlocked my phone and some approximation to how long ... BUT I use my phone to read non-fiction for study and some means of knowing which apps I've used for how long would add value.  It does recognise when I might be using my phone for navigation and gave me the option to not count that usage - so that's a good start.
SPACE - Break phone addiction,916126783,Great idea but...,1,"I love the idea of this, but it just doesn't work. At the moment it tells me I've used my phone for 3 minutes today- not true!

The whole concept of streaks and badges makes the journey a little easier, but by far the community on there helped me the most.

Maybe people could ‚Äúbattle‚Äù each other with these features. Anyways 10/10 great app ‚≠êÔ∏è"

Crown Solitaire: Card Game,1275760266,Good game but glitchy,4,"This is a good game, fun to play but the glitches spoil the experience. Glitches with freezes and slow movement. Fix that and it would be 5 stars üåü"
Crown Solitaire: Card Game,1275760266,Shame about ads,2,"Good relaxing game, except for the constant adds many of which are difficult to get out of. Some ads are not appropriate for general audiences like the female incontinence ones or the multiple bra ads. If these are not changed or very much reduced the game  will  be deleted. If you like to watch young and old females wetting themselves or stretching their bras and jumping up an$ down you may like this game."
Crown Solitaire: Card Game,1275760266,To many ads,1,"Why cant you subscribe to get rid of ads in this game as in other Mobility Ware games, they are just a annoyance and I would glady pay to get rid of them"
Crown Solitaire: Card Game,1275760266,Games slow & freeze,3,"Can you please have a look at Addiction, Castle, Crown games. Every time l use them they are slow & freeze up. Very frustrating. Disappointing as l enjoy playing your games"

7 Cups: Online Therapy & Chat,921814681,Love this app,4,I love this app I recommend it to all my family and friends as well as people in support groups I see struggling..   However I think this app should also add a journal section to the how are you feeling today so you can keep track of your emotions and being able to change between paths would be super helpful cos imma complicated being and would like to work on a few areas of myself at once
7 Cups: Online Therapy & Chat,921814681,Was a great app,2,"Was a great app and still is but it's funny how you can approach someone light heartedly and soft spoken through text, peacefully, and then they call you toxic and your account is unusable....it was a great app til it accepted posts about race....it's another Facebook platform now. Second account ditched. I will not try again a third time."
7 Cups: Online Therapy & Chat,921814681,The app broke,2,I did the most recent update and the app broke I keep clicking it but it won‚Äôt open I love the app way better than the website but now I‚Äôm stuck using the website fix it please. I am upset about the app not working anymore.
7 Cups: Online Therapy & Chat,921814681,Just a money scam so far,2,"So, you seem to be just like every person in this world money hungry? People download this app due to the fact no therapy is free and the prices in the world are going up causing more stresses in our life‚Äôs where do we turn now if apps are pushing for payment. I was doing the cups now it stuck on listener which I looked at and the only option is learn more upvote down vote( I did many downvotes due to it staying) I change activity but with out fail it goes back to the listener one. Please keep money out of it please fix your glitch or I‚Äôll remove app and I‚Äôll turn more on this horrid world. I have the option to pay I CANT AFFORD IT IM NEAR HOMELESS!! If I wanted to pay I‚Äôd pay but I can‚Äôt and the email triggered me so I never want to pay you a dime, here you can have my blood if you want to be like that the rest of your kind are taking my money like they the ones homeless and struggling"
7 Cups: Online Therapy & Chat,921814681,love the idea hate the execution,2,the app idea itself is really great but it‚Äôs downfall is the fact that i cannot open chats at all it just says error + i used to get around it by just using a google search (which worked on my phone and computer) but it does not work on my phone anymore  i used to love 7 cups but now i‚Äôm disliking it more and more every time i open it
Anxiety Free: iCan Hypnosis,410805846,Good,5,But do we get in the version upgrade on this
Anxiety Free: iCan Hypnosis,410805846,So darn good,5,"This one is worthy your attentive listening. Use your good headphones, have your cup of tea handy first thing of a morning... Skip intro button always works for me but sometimes I listen to gather my energies in preparation for the real listening time. The Scottish brogue accent captivates as well. A fine session every time. I think it's due to maturity & sincerity of his purpose. Very good app- go for gold"
Anxiety Free: iCan Hypnosis,410805846,Like it,4,"Good for stress management just wish the ""skip intro"" button would work, a bit tired of Donald's resume."
Anxiety Free: iCan Hypnosis,410805846,Thank you,5,"Thank you soooo much. I find this works brilliantly for me. I feel much calmer and relaxed and it makes me forget about my problems at least for a little while. Thank, you again."
Anxiety Free: iCan Hypnosis,410805846,Actually works (I know!!!!!),5,I often have that anxiety sensation like my heart drops down to my stomach when I get anxious about something that isn't even that bad and honestly I tried this a few months ago and it really stopped that sensation that I hate from arising! I really recommend this app it did wonders for me however it does ware off which is why I'm doing it again  The mans voice is super calming too  THANK YOU
Quit Weed Marijuana Addiction,1104097762,Cute basic app,4,"Hi there, I like this cute basic little app! Not sure if this is possible but it would be great to be able to edit the 'Reasons to quit' that you entered yourself. I need to fix a spelling mistake and to delete another but am unable to. It would also be great if you could add your own 'Panic' photos. If you could add font to the 'Badges' you could mention rewards that you are allowing yourself for the hard work out in. And lastly down the track a journal area would be awesome and if it could be linked to a calendar? Anyway thanks for the app so far :) Elyse"
Nomo -  Sobriety Clocks,566975787,Simple and effective,5,Really enjoying this app. The mindful and distraction  exercises are good and different to the usual ones.  It‚Äôs clean simple and easy to navigate.  Thank you.
Nomo -  Sobriety Clocks,566975787,A beautiful support,5,"This app is like a beautiful kind support person, not judging, just encouraging. It has been helping me for 3 years now. I have 3 clocks and they are all precious to me."
Nomo -  Sobriety Clocks,566975787,Security issues,1,Sent message about money taken from my account. Deleting this app immediately!
Nomo -  Sobriety Clocks,566975787,Extremely helpful tool in recovery,4,"It‚Äôs so easy to see how long I‚Äôve been improving for, how much I‚Äôve saved, and to solidify that I‚Äôm going well. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times seeing my progress has prevented a relapse.  On the note of the missing star - I find the app slow and glitchy at times. Occasionally it won‚Äôt load unless I exit like three times and reload the whole app.   Apart from that I would recommend and have recommended NoMo to several friends also struggling with addictions."
Nomo -  Sobriety Clocks,566975787,What the heck?,1,Why did this app just send me a notification saying ‚ÄúPayment approved - current user balance $1980.55‚Äù ?!?! Now it will not open at all. Deleting this app.
Recovery Path for Addiction,1450908550,I am so grateful for this app,5,Thank you for making this app and making it free! It seriously has all the tools you need to make it through recovery. So we‚Äôll put together and thought out. It‚Äôs really helping me through
Recovery Path for Addiction,1450908550,Amazing app,5,"What a fantastic app, possibly the most useful tool I have found in my recovery journey. Often I want to sure my thoughts with other friends and family and the ability to send updates to my contacts is outstanding. I will use this app daily for the foreseeable future!"
Seed: Gamify No Nut Quit Porn,6636516894,Terrible,1,Literally can‚Äôt use without spending money thought I could actually benefit from this but I guess the developers just want to scam people who want to stop watching porn
Seed: Gamify No Nut Quit Porn,6636516894,10/10,5,It personally connected with me and told me what i needed to do and keep on the right track. Highly recommend
Seed: Gamify No Nut Quit Porn,6636516894,Felt like a scam,1,"I was genuinely excited about Seed it seemed like exactly what I needed. At first, everything worked smoothly, and I started to think this might actually be a game changer. But just as I was getting into it, everything stopped. A paywall appeared out of nowhere, completely blocking access. No warning, no transparency just a sudden demand for money. It feels like a bait and switch, and honestly, it was disappointing. If they had been upfront from the start, I wouldn‚Äôt have minded. But leading users on, only to pull the rug out from under them? That just feels unfair. I really wanted to love this app, but instead, I just feel let down."
Seed: Gamify No Nut Quit Porn,6636516894,Don‚Äôt try,1,"They lure you into a false sense of security, before asking you to subscribe in order to use the app. It‚Äôs not optional, you have no choice but to either get the subscription or you are in your own. Disgusting, preying on people with genuine health issues for monetary gain."
Seed: Gamify No Nut Quit Porn,6636516894,Paywall,1,I find it disgusting that an app created and targeted for people who are trying to better themselves and improve their wellbeing would enforce a paywall after making you sign your name and signature. Pure manipulation.
New Addiction Solitaire,870325718,Too many bugs,1,Would be a good game if it wasn't filled with bugs. Some cards can't be seen and other times cards are repeated.
Daily Tracker Journal & Diary,306026134,Best friend,5,I have been struggling with growing in Faith and I realised it‚Äôs not because I don‚Äôt love Jesus Christ but it‚Äôs because I have not planned myself well enough . Thanks so much for making life smoother ..
Daily Tracker Journal & Diary,306026134,Great app,5,"I‚Äôm very grateful that this developer hasn‚Äôt jumped in the subscription bandwagon. The money I‚Äôve paid for the app has been well worth it and I‚Äôd be willing to continue to support the developer financially.  I‚Äôd suggest the developer put a donation button in the app‚Äîit would be fairly easy I imagine. Then people, like myself, could show our appreciation."
Daily Tracker Journal & Diary,306026134,Laura,4,"This app is wonderful! I have tried many, many apps to help me get organized & be more productive, and this is the best one by far. It is comprehensive, versatile, sophisticated, elegant & fun to use. It is for the connoiseurs of organisation & efficiency who also enjoy using an app instead of pen & paper. Well worth its price, & I even prefer its former name, ""Lumen Trails"""
Daily Tracker Journal & Diary,306026134,Senior Citizen  84  This App is in constant use,5,"I still use this app every day for over a year. Which is a recommendation in its self Thank you It is now over  many I have lost count the years I have continued to use ""Lumen Trails"" I now class it as my most useful they keep on improving it App I can easily recommend it to any one who wants to keep track of anything it is that versatile I recently had to use one-one-support And their response was great  They say proof of the pudding is in the eating. You prove it with every update Congratulations Senior Citizen 84 Still going at 84 Regards *****"
Daily Tracker Journal & Diary,306026134,Works really well,4,"Helps me to keep track of my activities, especially when I need to go back and check what events occurred on which day.  Search function very useful."
AppBlock: App & Site Blocker,1515753232,Does not work,1,"Very frustrating. Paid for the premium monthly service but the app will not enable any premium features. Unsure if I should cancel and uninstall or just wait for the features to become available. :( was also (separately) unable to use my valid google play subscription on a new apple device, which is doubly frustrating. Very disappointed."
AppBlock: App & Site Blocker,1515753232,Helping me reduce mindless scrolling,4,The app has made a big difference to the time I spend looking at my phone daily
AppBlock: App & Site Blocker,1515753232,Does what is Says and does it well!,5,Great app and one I‚Äôll be resubscribing for another year
AppBlock: App & Site Blocker,1515753232,Wasted an hour on this app.,1,This app only gives two free days of the distraction feature every week and free version is hard to set up.
AppBlock: App & Site Blocker,1515753232,A Bit Buggy,3,The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 4-5 stars is because it gets a bit buggy and wouldn‚Äôt let me get into some apps.  I found this the case only when I clicked whole categories and then de-selected the apps I wanted out of said categories.   I got around the bugs but just selected the specific apps I wanted blocked.   Works a treat after that.

QuitNow!,483994930,Great app,5,"An awesome app, once you have set it up it‚Äôs shows you  how much money you are saving from quitting smoking. . That alone can keep you on track for that healthy smoke free lifestyle we deserve."
Quit Drinking,1529925171,Spam,1,"You ask me for a review 4 times whilst using the app. It‚Äôs annoying, so 1 star"

Quit Drinking,1529925171,Sent is believing,5,"Recently separated, frequently sad and often drunk  so I don‚Äôt dream. You have no idea how much seeing the money I am saving each day helps."
Quit Drinking,1529925171,Good app,4,It does exactly what I hoped it would and slightly more. Nothing incredible 4/5
Quit Drinking,1529925171,Too US Centric,2,It wouldn‚Äôt kill you to add multi-currency and metric measurements.
RealizD - Screen Time Tracker,1041249752,"Not a ""free"" app at all",2,"Hard to tell whether this app works as intended, because the free version only tracks the current day, and you lose all that information when the clock ticks over at midnight. Essentially, you can't use the app for anything useful until you pay money, so putting it in the ""free"" category is misleading.  Also, for the one limited feature that is available for free, it didn't track my usage accurately at all. I used my iPad for about 5 hours straight with only 2 or 3 short breaks, and it tracked it as 2 picks up of 1 minute each lol, and the rest of the time idle lol."
RealizD - Screen Time Tracker,1041249752,"It‚Äôs a great app, but I can‚Äôt make an account",2,"The app will not let me create an account. I go thru the process and all, but then when the loading screen comes up, it just goes away and nothing happens. Help please"
RealizD - Screen Time Tracker,1041249752,Needs to not track GPS,4,Great app! Would be great if you could set an option to not count GPS usage however
RealizD - Screen Time Tracker,1041249752,Good but......,4,This is a great app. Would be even better if the iOS app allowed for app usage tracking. If you could add that. That would be great. Cheers
RealizD - Screen Time Tracker,1041249752,Awesome app,5,Apparently I picked up my phone every 12 mins today. That's scary... This app gives you easy to understand data about your habits which is the first step to making changes!
Lyf App - Social That Cares,909556526,Best for support,5,"Probably the best app I‚Äôve used as a place to express my emotions and feel supported by a community going through similar things as me. It‚Äôs hard having a mental illness and feeling alone, but I don‚Äôt with Lyf x"

Lyf App - Social That Cares,909556526,One of the only positive parts of social media,5,This app is what makes social media good.
Migiri: Porn Blocker & More,1551848949,Wouldn‚Äôt know if the app is any good,2,"This app not sort of feels like a money grab off people struggling trying to overcome addiction, $250 yearly is rather expensive to get rid of a habit that could ruin you"
Migiri: Porn Blocker & More,1551848949,My personal Review,5,This is the app you needed and yearned for. It ain't cheap but it is also the perfect price if you want to have control over your life Again.
Migiri: Porn Blocker & More,1551848949,"Great app, needs different payment methods",5,"The app so far is amazing I love the milestone achievements and the lesson that come along with it, just wish there was a monthly payment method instead of the big 1 year/$250 payment."
Migiri: Porn Blocker & More,1551848949,.,4,There should be option to unblock app from migri filter.
Migiri: Porn Blocker & More,1551848949,No show on appointment,1,Hi I booked one on one appointment for 90 dollars and the therapist did not show up. I took time off work and was waiting for 15 mins .  I want my refund asap

Relay: Quit Porn Addiction,1569873335,A program that‚Äôs actually different,5,"This program has been life changing for me because I don‚Äôt feel alone in my struggles anymore. I now have a team on the app that helps me fight through temptations, regular zoom meetings, and I‚Äôve learnt so much about how addiction works and the common misconceptions people think. If you honestly want to be free from addiction, Relay is a huge step in the right direction, and for a very affordable price. The Relay team really show care to everyone using Relay and that goes a long way in fighting addiction."

Fabulous: Daily Habit Tracker,1203637303,Stealing is not a business model‚Ä¶,1,"Almost $500 was wrongfully taken from my account even though I unsubscribed before the free trial ended. I provided clear proof of my cancellation, yet they are refusing a refund, hiding behind a vague ‚Äúpolicy.‚Äù This is blatant theft and a clear scam. Stealing is not a business model‚Ä¶"

Fabulous: Daily Habit Tracker,1203637303,Unapproved charges - scam! Beware,1,This app charges you for things you did not sign up for. Avoid at all costs.
Fabulous: Daily Habit Tracker,1203637303,Overly Complicated,1,This app is very pretty but that‚Äôs about it. For what the app is trying to achieve it should be far more simplified and straightforward. I‚Äôm sure it works for some but not for me.
Fitbit: Health & Fitness,462638897,Buggy update,1,Since the last update the device keeps disconnecting from my phone. Sleep tracking is extremely inaccurate. Not sure if I will persevere with Fitbit.

I am - Daily Affirmations,874656917,Shifty,1,I said it would notify me after 3 days of free trial. But it did not. And just like that signed me up for A WHOLE YEAR!!!!! I did not want this!!!
I am - Daily Affirmations,874656917,Not free!,1,I had to answer a bunch of questions just to find out that i only had a three day free trial. I suggest you add to the app another setting where people can at least get the most basic features for free.
I am - Daily Affirmations,874656917,A nice idea not executed well,2,"The idea of this app is nice, but the absurd frequent rate of change of the affirmations during the day and the seemingly blatant disregard the notifications have for the user‚Äôs settings make it more of a nuisance than anything else. If I say I don‚Äôt want reminders or notifications, I truly mean that I don‚Äôt want reminders or notifications, and it‚Äôs poor UX to hide the toggles for those settings across multiple screens. The option to see a single affirmation for the day/week would be a great addition. Seeing a new one every hour, despite the user‚Äôs settings, doesn‚Äôt give the human brain long enough to consider it, let alone adopt it."
I am - Daily Affirmations,874656917,Great App,5,"I have been using I am for a while and it just keeps getting better. I enjoy receiving affirmations throughout the day on my phone or my watch. When they bank up it is a nice mindful moment to stop and read through them all. Lately, I had been through all the relevant categories of affirmations and honestly, I was starting to get bored. Then I found the AI function! I am impressed. This is exactly what I wanted. Please keep refining and improving the app. It is a life changer."
I am - Daily Affirmations,874656917,App is amazing but could you bring the theme back,4,"Since the last few updates, the plain theme (plain black letter with white background) was removed. Could you please bring it back?"
Peptalk: Daily Self Motivation,976885594,Money hungry and misleading,1,I am thoroughly dissatisfied by the app. It allows maybe 30 seconds worth of content and puts everything else behind a pay wall. The features are hard to navigate and their customer service team is unhelpful and slow. The yearly sale that pops up bypasses the 3 day trial period which they do not inform you of and will not give you any help whatsoever when you ask for a refund. I‚Äôm writing a review to apple directly to try and get a refund. Be very wary if you choose to use the app.

Productive - Habit Tracker,983826477,Got really greedy,1,"I was happy enough to pay the $60 annual fee for the ability to see history: had I given my dog her monthly flea meds?  But then they doubled it, so I went back to free. Now, to create a new habit they want me to pay $10 a week or $150 a year?! The gamification does nothing for me, and things like alerts or whatever are basically ways to cause anxiety (look at the psychology research) not actually help people get motivated - it does the opposite. So now they‚Äôre trying to turn something simple that was really useful into a way to gouge people. Really disappointing."
Productive - Habit Tracker,983826477,Just about to double in price!,1,Great app that does everything I need it to do. Just got a random alert that the annual price is about to DOUBLE for zero app improvements in years to its value or features. So I immediately cancelled my subscription. Disappointed snd annoyed by the blatant display of GREED
Productive - Habit Tracker,983826477,I Highly recommend this,5,The most fascinating part of this app is the way it works with your own needs
Weight Loss Hypnosis,576997550,Helps me get back on track,5,Post Christmas or any time I feel myself slipping back into old habits I use the app to get back on track.
Weight Loss Hypnosis,576997550,Lost weight!!!(updated!),5,"(Deleted old review)  Update::  I have lost weight!!! So after about 3 months of listening consistently..  I really noticed big changes (and as I say that I realise they‚Äôre words in the hypnosis!)  But I have!  I started feeling really good about myself, feeling like I was working towards my own vision for myself and I started dedicating myself more to exercise and eating better!  Devoting time and effort to my body!  I am feeling the best I have felt in a loong time! Consistency (over time)  is key!"
Weight Loss Hypnosis,576997550,When are you updating,1,You need to update the pro apps we have paid good money for them and deserve to be able to use what we paid for.
Weight Loss Hypnosis,576997550,Lose weight,5,Subliminal messages gently lull you off to sleep with pleasant images and a soft soothing voice. Works brilliantly for me.
Weight Loss Hypnosis,576997550,Best app for helping weight loss,5,I have been using this app for 5 months and have lost 14 kgs without even trying to diet. It has allowed me to control my food choices and has stopped me from emotional eating as well. I now walk into the pantry and look at the food and walk back out again without having food in my hand where as before the app I would walk out with unhealthy snacks. I use it every night before sleep and it helps me go to sleep as well. Definitely worth the investment.

Fitness Buddy Home Gym Workout,514780106,Be Careful,1,I have paid for an annual subscription however my account was deleted not long after. Going around in circles with Danica refusing to fix my issue. Don‚Äôt pay for something you won‚Äôt receive people and horrible customer service‚Ä¶beware‚Ä¶
Fitness Buddy Home Gym Workout,514780106,Inconsistent Pricing,2,"I‚Äôm trying to upgrade to the premium version. It says subscription is $29.99 a year then when you click on it, the price changes to $42.99. Which one is it? Is this some sort of click bait?"
Fitness Buddy Home Gym Workout,514780106,Scam app,1,Just charged me $80 then wants another $46 don‚Äôt bother I want my money back
Fitness Buddy Home Gym Workout,514780106,Okay,3,"Wasn‚Äôt to bad, would be great if it was actually free and no hidden in app purchases !!"
Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,1241229134,This is me,5,When I downloaded this app my life changed
Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,1241229134,Reflecty- journal ai diary,2,Bought on discount the app. It says I must be premium to add voice journaling. I just can tap. Barely write much when I used my microphone. Adds lots of other apps I can‚Äôt add as a gift  - have too many already- and never opted for bundles. Too confusing when I just asked for journaling. Wrote to support that never replied. Disappointed by this product for my needs
Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,1241229134,Very good,5,I find it good for those who need it
Reflectly - Journal & AI Diary,1241229134,Amazing ü§©,5,So I was struggling from low self esteem and I‚Äôve tried multiple apps to help me get motivation and none of them worked but reflecty is something else it‚Äôs so amazing because you have a daily quote and a daily challenge as well as a daily gratitude reminder!!

Gratitude: Self-Care Journal,1372575227,The one that makes me stick,5,"I tried A LOT of self-care app. I ended up getting bored, or just simply having no interest at all after few weeks. This is the only app that will make me go back and write. Yes I skipped it for few weeks/months, but I always go back to write. I also love how they have questions to help me write, because I am that someone who has a lot to say, but when they ask me to write it, I go blank!"

Balance: Meditation & Sleep,1361356590,Highly recommend,5,There‚Äôs something for everyone and something for everyday in the wonderful app.
Balance: Meditation & Sleep,1361356590,Meditation app,4,"I‚Äôve been using this app since July 2024 and I have learned more in the last 8 months about meditation than I have in years of practice. I especially like that you can choose different plans on a daily basis, depending on what you feel you need."
Balance: Meditation & Sleep,1361356590,I owe my wellbeing to this app - Beyond Perfect,5,"It has changed my life. I‚Äôve been using Balance for the last 5 years, supporting my life‚Äôs biggest changes.   It‚Äôs helped me since I was in my final year of high school during COVID, and then into university, and then through my parents‚Äô divorce, and then through my first heartbreak and nearly losing my little brother. It has helped me tremendously in building emotional resilience and soothing my anxiety disorder. I am stronger for it.   This is truly the best app for meditation training, and well worth the paid subscription or life time payment if you make it a consistent habit using the free singles.   Ofosu and Leah, you guys are legends. Honestly, thank you for this."
Balance: Meditation & Sleep,1361356590,Not Free,1,How can you advertise free for a year ? When clearly it‚Äôs not free ?

Moonly: Moon Calendar & Phases,1489889871,Good customer service,4,There‚Äôs nowhere to retrieve a yearly purchase in the app but it‚Äôs asking you to pay again!   Update:- The issue has been resolved. Thank you!
Moonly: Moon Calendar & Phases,1489889871,Still more to pay after moonly plus,1,"I was very upset to find out that the $100 lifetime access to Moonly Plus was not the actual complete access it seems to be. There is an extra payment for the runes component of $80, and another $80 for access to morning and evening rituals, as well as an extra $15 for a personal yearly forecast.   I was also extremely disappointed that there is no option to choose between using the eastern or western astrology signs, as I feel that my western sun and moon signs are more accurate.  I have not tested out the other ‚Äòextra‚Äô features as yet, but so far am extremely disappointed, and wish that the lifetime access was actually access to everything, and that they had the option of choosing the astrology system, at the very least for the actual birth chart itself."
Moonly: Moon Calendar & Phases,1489889871,Used to love this app,1,"I purchased a lifetime subscription in 2022, recently the app has not allowed me to use any of the features and won‚Äôt let me restore the purchase or any of my data. The developers website is down, the restore feature isn‚Äôt working and I am extremely annoyed and upset."
Moonly: Moon Calendar & Phases,1489889871,Waste of money,2,"I paid for the subscription then not only had I paid for a subscription but after you pay for the subscription it makes you pay for another one time payment  before you can even use the app so I‚Äôve wasted money on nothing, I got zero information out of my subscription"
Moonly: Moon Calendar & Phases,1489889871,The worst,1,The app is so inaccurate and not worthy the money. I‚Äôve been a Pisces my whole life and I keeps telling me I‚Äôm a Taurus. Will be seeking a refund through Apple. Such a rip off
My Diet Coach - Weight Loss,552341639,Hey,5,Hey
My Diet Coach - Weight Loss,552341639,Great but not in Australia,3,I liked the app but I couldn‚Äôt add Australian brands so I couldn‚Äôt really make it work for me.
My Diet Coach - Weight Loss,552341639,You have to pay,2,I had this app for only a day and I can‚Äôt log my dinner because I need a subscription?? If I try it just kicks me out of the app or shows me an advertisement saying I need to pay.
My Diet Coach - Weight Loss,552341639,Loveeeü§ç,4,"In my opinion I think this is one of the best weight loss apps out there. There are so many options on how and why you want to loose weight following very specific details making it a pretty accurate app. But there is one thing that‚Äôs a bit frustrating and it‚Äôs that when I try to log what I ate for lunch , dinner etc it just randomly takes me out of the app to my Home Screen, idk if it‚Äôs a glitch or not???"
My Diet Coach - Weight Loss,552341639,Really good but expensive,4,"This app is great, and super pretty to look at. The features are really fun and it definitely helps you get a diet specific to you. However a lot of features are premium only which is $7.99 a week."

Mindvalley: Self Development,1108786610,Grateful beyond measure,5,"Ever grateful for coming across MindValley in my instagram feed. Finally finallly listening to Regan Hillyer resonated with me. I had started listening to positive affirmations recently and the last couple of months I started a positive affirmations journal and I just started to write and things have started to appear to manifest in my life without ANY effort then I discovered MindValley and it was exactly what I have been searching for without knowing. I feel a different kind of gratitude, joy, happiness and peace that I have not felt before and the courses are amazing and transformative. I have noticed incredible changes within myself in a short space of time. Thank you üôèüèΩ"

"Alarmy: Loud Alarm Clock,Sleep",1163786766,Destroyed my old phone,2,Constantly played when I went out of the house and killed the battery. I‚Äôm still going to use it because I don‚Äôt get up in the morning without it. üò≠
"Alarmy: Loud Alarm Clock,Sleep",1163786766,This app is the best definitely recommended,4,"I am ten years old and I always sleep inbut Alarmy has made waking up so much easier, you can choose your alarm sound and a challenge so when your alarm wakes you up it will give you a challenge witch for me definitely has improved me getting up earlier and happier. Now you may be thinking that this is not your jam but really give it a try it will change your life. A few problems thoe, It is a bit hard to work and it can get confusing so I think there are some thing that need to be fixed but otherwise this app is fantastic definitely use and definitely up to standards ü™ºü¶≠üêùüçâüçíüçá.

"Alarmy: Loud Alarm Clock,Sleep",1163786766,Good app,5,"This was amazing, it works so well 5/5"
"Alarmy: Loud Alarm Clock,Sleep",1163786766,Absolute Garbage,1,"I‚Äôve never written a review in my life but this app really deserves one, if only to serve a warning to others. My native iPhone app was playing up so I downloaded this one. Morning 1 was ok, but I was a little annoyed it was so difficult to turn off. I don‚Äôt have any puzzles to solve or anything I just set a simple alarm, I didn‚Äôt realize that the iOS software didn‚Äôt allow this app to have a dismiss button on the front side of the Lock Screen, so I had to unlock the phone then navigate to the app, open it, and dismiss the alarm. Morning 2 was this morning and it was the worst morning of my life. The alarm went off and despite all my best efforts I could not turn the alarm off. No matter what I did there was no ‚Äúdismiss‚Äù screen. It was going off its head, my wife screaming at me, silent switch didn‚Äôt stop it, turning the volume down was fought by the app turning it back up again. I was really getting annoyed at this point and then my wife kicked me outside. So there I was in my underwear out on the front porch in my underwear swearing at my phone in the freezing cold and rain. Guys, the only way to turn the alarm off was to remove the app from my phone. I must have had the puzzle set to ultimate difficulty, the kind that makes you go outside half naked, that will wake you up. Stay away, if you download this app you must have rocks in your head."
"Routine Planner, Habit Tracker",1450486923,Improve reminders,4,Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt remind me of the tasks
"Routine Planner, Habit Tracker",1450486923,Great app,4,This app is super good for organisations especially if you get distracted easily or put things off a lot. There are just a few improvements i can suggest.   Maybe if there could be an option for sub tasks it would be easier to manage. As a student if I can have sub tasks then I can easily organise what work I need to get done for which subjects.  If there could be a free option for multiple routines it would be nice because the limit of 2 routines just isn‚Äôt cutting it for me. I have different tuitions and classes which run for different times on different days so it‚Äôs hard for me to stick to just the 2 routines. Also because I want different routines for my studies and chores and with just one for both I get mixed up easily.  Thanks!
"Routine Planner, Habit Tracker",1450486923,The motivation I needed,5,Helps motivate me to stay on track and recognise how much time tasks actually take. Used it with my ADHD son this morning and we had a spare 15 mins to play a game together before school and weren‚Äôt stressed getting out of the door ü•∞ That‚Äôs priceless!

Forest: Focus for Productivity,866450515,Amazing app,5,Good for focusing and getting off the phone
Forest: Focus for Productivity,866450515,Not worth it. Do not download.,1,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app. If it were free it could be okay but don‚Äôt know why it has such a high price tag for what it provides.  There are better free productivity apps out there.  The app even has further in-app purchases which are pushed so the greedy developers can profit more. You wouldn‚Äôt think this paid app would make you purchase items to make a prettier forest.  Customer support takes extremely long to respond also so you‚Äôd better pray you have no issues with your download.  0/10 for its pricing
Forest: Focus for Productivity,866450515,Stop pestering me to update!,1,"I am so close to uninstalling the app. I will update the app if I wish to. I don‚Äôt want whatever damn AI stuff they talked about adding. The app works fine as it is and I will never accept the prompt to update no matter how many times it gets in my face.

Happy Scale,532430574,Awesome app,5,"I‚Äôve been using this for years. It has helped me lose weight in a sensible manner, with its feature of being able to reduce a large number down in to small goals."
Happy Scale,532430574,My fav weight loss tracker,5,"I have had this app for several years now. The features make it fun and engaging to track my weight but also gives me very solids predictions. It makes weigh-in‚Äôs fun! Highly recommend at least giving the free version a try, and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll enjoy it so much you‚Äôll want the full version too. Happy Scaling!"
Happy Scale,532430574,Happiness Log,5,Works a treat
Happy Scale,532430574,A motivational way to view and analyse weight data already in Apple Health,4,"I really enjoy using Happy Scale and am a paid subscriber. It has great features to analyse the weight data in Apple Health, celebrate progress and show the predicted path to hitting your target (be that to go up or down). I find it really motivating to stay on track with my goals. Minus one star because the sync between devices uses Dropbox instead of iCloud, which on an iPhone/iPad app is as dumb as a box of hammers."
Fitness Buddy+ Gym Workout Log,443646748,Fix you damn App,1,"Very long time user of full paid version. Growing increasingly frustrated of the bugs after every update.  Test you damn update prior. Been at least three days with bunch of new bugs, sort it out quick or lose this customer."
Fitness Buddy+ Gym Workout Log,443646748,Mostly everything I need,4,This app is more than adequate for what I need in terms of fitness and strength training. It's easy to navigate however when I want to add a new exercise to my workout it doesn‚Äôt save it in the following workouts which is annoying. Also the app will decide to close near the end of a workout at times and is a bug that requires fixing.
Fitness Buddy+ Gym Workout Log,443646748,Lots of annoying updates,2,"Latest update is buggy and a lot of free features have now been moved to subscription only. Whenever the app is fixed, another update always seems to ruin it one way or another."
Fitness Buddy+ Gym Workout Log,443646748,Not so great,3,"This app was great right up until I have to go premium to open any of the workouts, I did pay for this app it should still work without having to subscribe to a more expensive version! I‚Äôm very disappointed."
Fitness Buddy+ Gym Workout Log,443646748,Brilliant,5,Used it for years.  Does everything you need and more.

Activations: Daily Motivation,1520094701,Listen to change your life,5,"I‚Äôve been using activations since it begun, prior to that Mimis meditations via her website. The evolution of this app has been blissful to watch, because the app itself enhances your personal evolution. Fundamentally, if you want to change, you need to change your energy. This app does that for you, no matter what aspects of life/& life you are wanting to create for yourself, this app helps you do so. It has so many different categories, it‚Äôs a one stop shop that can active your energy in all kinds of scenarios. The music and the spoken words of Mimi instantly shifts your energy to a higher state. There is no other audio that compares to it.I‚Äôm so grateful this app exists and I know you will be to once you try it, you won‚Äôt go back. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Activations: Daily Motivation,1520094701,Life changing and well worth the investment,5,"This has literally changed my life which sounds cliche but it is so true. Still requires the effort of showing up every day and listening to an activation but once you get into that habit it is addictive! I love how is it is to incorporate into every single day of my life. It doesn‚Äôt require sitting in silence on your own which is just not possible all the time as a mum but to be able to pop on a meditation during a workout, cooking, cleaning, while driving it just really takes all the boxes it is well worth the investment."
Activations: Daily Motivation,1520094701,Cancelled and was still charged,1,"I signed up for the free trial, was really unimpressed with the activations and tried to cancel. It‚Äôs super unclear how to do this so I emailed and sent a message. Had one response with vague instructions and managed to cancel. I was then still charged once the free trial was over!"
Activations: Daily Motivation,1520094701,I never do this,5,"This is the first review I‚Äôve ever left on Apple Store. And I‚Äôve used Apple for years. That must say a lot?? Anyway- I‚Äôve also never paid a yearly subs for an app that cost me more than $35. I don‚Äôt even meditate!   But for some reason, I just can‚Äôt stop listening to activations. It‚Äôs just addicting in the best way possible. Try it, you won‚Äôt regret it :)"
Activations: Daily Motivation,1520094701,Phenomenal but unaffordable,5,"About a week into my superman app and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve use an app so intensely in such a short space of time.  I‚Äôm making the most of it, as an Aussie girl it‚Äôs just so unaffordable which breaks my heart."

Liven: Discover yourself,6450840109,No reminders after trial,2,The app itself was just ok - but I never got a welcome email or details on the subscription until after I cancelled when I saw the aud $60+ that came out of my account  Way over priced for what it provides .

"Journey - Diary, Journal",1300202543,Love this app,5,Great journal app it has everything you could want in a journal.
"Journey - Diary, Journal",1300202543,Not sure what to make of this App.,3,"I‚Äôve had it for a week. Typing new journal entries is like using an early wordprocessor.  Basic functions have to hunted down before you can use them - IF THEY WORK.  Delete one word and you lose the paragraph.  Try to insert a picture from Photos and you have an invisible thing, you can‚Äôt delete.  Try to navigate with the arrow keys and the cursor moves soooo slowly, that it‚Äôs quicker to resort to the track-pad.  I did managed to cutNpaste previous entries from Apple‚Äôs iPhone Journal and I‚Äôm wondering if the App is too full, which does not bode well for long term use.  I want this App to work, as it is suppose to work across iPhone, iPad & iMac.  There‚Äôs more, but who‚Äôs interested?  Signed, Frustrated:("

"Simple Habit Sleep, Meditation",1093360165,Goood,5,I have to stress now thanks to this app
"Simple Habit Sleep, Meditation",1093360165,Love it!,5,"Although i dont have premium the app is still fantastic! There is a bunch of free stuff, meditations and things like that. And personally these have really helped me and I‚Äôve benefited heaps from the app. I would 110% recommend this app to anyone and everyone. And it‚Äôs a great app if you‚Äôre like me and can‚Äôt for whatever reason pay for a subscription!"
"Simple Habit Sleep, Meditation",1093360165,LOVE THIS APP,5,When I downloaded this app I had no idea how much I would like it!!! I have had absolutely no problems with it! üòçüòçüòçüòç
"Simple Habit Sleep, Meditation",1093360165,Sound keeps dropping out,1,I just purchased this app and tried a few different yoga videos. The sound kept dropping out. I‚Äôd pause the video toggle the mute on and off. I would get it to work again but always it would fail with the audio again and again. It had a very stress inducing affect. My phone is less than 6 months old.
Habio: Habit Tracker & Planner,1517360968,Good,5,Hello! Using Habio has helped me develop routines that I've been trying to establish for years. This app really works!
Habio: Habit Tracker & Planner,1517360968,Waste of money,1,Really basic boring app with no helpful features. Wouldn‚Äôt even get it again if it was free. False advertising about things it clearly doesn‚Äôt offer.
Habio: Habit Tracker & Planner,1517360968,Rip off,1,The auto subscription charged me over $100. This is on top of the $14 for the trial. They do not send out reminders of when an auto subscription is due. They are taking advantage of people with ADHD who struggle with executive function.  Also the app is slow and not user friendly. Do not download! It‚Äôs a rip off
Habio: Habit Tracker & Planner,1517360968,Absolute thieves,1,They make it ridiculously hard to unsubscribe and fleece your hard ofyour hard earned dollars for nothing
Habio: Habit Tracker & Planner,1517360968,SCAM,1,"DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS! And beware of the ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù an absolute scam of an app that once in - good luck getting out. Not connected to Apple subscriptions, to unsubscribe they make you jump through hoops and their service response takes weeks. They have a laundry list of ways you can request a refund which is a SCAM SCAM SCAM RUN AWAY. The app is also so detailed requiring a lot of input and navigates not so clearly, that in hindsight anyone with ADHD/ADD would not benefit from this setup. Feels ai created and managed. Highly do not recommend."
ThinkUp-Daily Affirmations app,906660772,Good tool,4,"I use this app nearly everyday and it is easy to use. It could be improved by having a filter that stays where you left it, rather than defaulting back to #Allaffirmations every day, and a streak counter that works. I have a daily streak counter of 1, day after day after day. But if those things are not important to you, this app might be for you."
ThinkUp-Daily Affirmations app,906660772,Outstanding!,5,As someone who‚Äôs just recently embraced the practice of affirmations - this App has made it so easy to implement and practice. The features surprised me. You won‚Äôt regret getting this.
ThinkUp-Daily Affirmations app,906660772,Brilliant,5,Excellent for affirmations!
ThinkUp-Daily Affirmations app,906660772,Garbled words,1,I go to sleep listening to my recordings. I woke up to hear the affirmations I had recorded all garbled as if they were in a different language. Probably not best to take that into your sleep. Deleted the app and cancelled the sub.
ThinkUp-Daily Affirmations app,906660772,Outstanding,5,"Not only do I love the app, if ever there is an issue customer service focus is brilliant. The app can be personalised to a high degree and that (to me) is critical - if you‚Äôre not comfortable with your affirmations in every way you won‚Äôt listen to them. I‚Äôm using this app every day."

stoic. journal & mental health,1312926037,Great,5,"Even from a simple prompt, that I even knew already (Five Whys) had a significant positive benefit. Something about how it's structured stepped me though it in a new way giving insight I hadn't seen before. Thank you."
stoic. journal & mental health,1312926037,Desktop version,1,"Can you allow copying of images or the ability to add photos from any drive I choose, please.  I know phone version probably takes priority, but the deskptop version is quite cumbersome to use and takes me out of the flow of my writing.   I do enjoy the simple UI."

Model My Diet - Women,891448329,Great start,3,"I‚Äôve purchased the full app, it‚Äôs pretty ok.   Would like to see more variation in facial features and the ability to import body measurements.   Also my body shape changes as I lose weight, but I'm not able to see this reflected in the model.   So far only 3/5 but would be 5/5 if the above changes were made"
Model My Diet - Women,891448329,Great!!,5,It‚Äôs encouraging to see how you change over your weight loss
Model My Diet - Women,891448329,Measurements would help,3,"It‚Äôs great motivation to see the before and possible after but body shape isn‚Äôt very realistic. It would be great to be able to input chest, stomach and hip circumference at minimum. Otherwise it‚Äôs just a bit a of fun."
Model My Diet - Women,891448329,My Model review,4,"Love the visuals but I wish you had an avatar you could dress up and be more relatable more options. Eg clothes, gender, hairstyle, shoes business and bags etc. Even pets lol Also make it so men can use it as well.  Could put the pictures also in a graph of weight loss as well along with the photo album that way you see it on the graph as well with the BMI beside it. This would be awesome."
Model My Diet - Women,891448329,This keeps me motivated,5,"I love this app, it keeps me motivated and gives me an end result. Very motivating üòÄ"
Shmoody: Mood & Habit Tracker,1534196157,CANCELLED TRIAL & CHARGED $110,1,I cancelled before the trial and still charged for subscription. App confirmed subscription was cancelled!!! Very angry
Shmoody: Mood & Habit Tracker,1534196157,Wouldn‚Äôt even bother,1,"I tried the trial and cancelled before the charge date; the interface was hard, and as someone who struggles with attention space and visuals, it was chaotic and asked TOO many questions! Didn‚Äôt find it helpful.  After cancelling the trial, they still charged me two weeks later, but can‚Äôt seem to get my money back via the App Store (as it states I wasn‚Äôt charged - even though the money came out of my account). Tried to call the service number, not connected, and there isn‚Äôt any other way to contact them.  Costly and Not Helpful"
Shmoody: Mood & Habit Tracker,1534196157,Don‚Äôt waste your money,1,Look at all these bad reviews ! I was scammed the same way even though I canceled my free trial before it was up and they won‚Äôt allow refunds. I wish I checked reviews first .. imagine .. a self care app scamming people money ..
Shmoody: Mood & Habit Tracker,1534196157,Scam,1,"I have ADHD and this obviously came up in my FYP as advertised to help. I signed up for their trial but it never worked from the beginning. Only a black screen. I totally forgot about it I didn‚Äôt cancel in time and was charged the full amount at the end. I reached out to their support but never received a reply and it‚Äôs really not worth my time and energy to fight it. All in all, this was a very expensive lesson. I think it‚Äôs predatory to target neurodivergent people, pretending to be a great app and using this subscription tactic."
Shmoody: Mood & Habit Tracker,1534196157,Stole my money,1,"I needed to cancel my web subscription before the trial expired and I was trying to contact the help center on the chat. On my first try no agent replied to me and the message that I got was that they would be back on tuesday. So I wait until tuesday morning to text them and again, there is no agent available and they will be back tomorrow‚Ä¶ So now while I waited for them my trial ended and they charged 111 dollars from my bank account.. Quite a disappointing experience"

Digipill: Guided Meditation,578068250,Odd,3,"I have been practicing mindfulness for years and used many apps. The sound effects and the voice make it sound like a porno, it was really hard to take seriously. I tried about 4 of the pills but never made it through the full recording. I had to turn it off."
Digipill: Guided Meditation,578068250,Sleep,5,"Amazing, would highly recommended *****"
Digipill: Guided Meditation,578068250,Have to pay,1,You download the free app and it give you access to one meditation. If you want any other meditation you have to pay separately.
Digipill: Guided Meditation,578068250,Digipill,1,Impossible to find zen when your listening to what sounds like Hannibal Lecter and and porn music from the 70s

"TIDE: Sleep, Focus, Meditation",1077776989,I have one complaint,4,‚ÄúRoof‚Äù was my favourite sleep sound after I endured two house fires in 6 months and could no longer use ‚ÄúStove Fire‚Äù due to anxiety and I‚Äôm sad that it‚Äôs been moved to the membership only collection instead of remaining free. I can‚Äôt justify nearly $20 a month for one sound and the other rain ones just aren‚Äôt the same. I wish you‚Äôd consider changing it back or making it possible to purchase individual sounds without a membership. This complaint still stands four years later. I really wish you‚Äôd make it free again.

Primed Mind: #1 Mindset App,1224121850,Don‚Äôt risk it!,1,They charged my credit card even though I cancelled & deleted my account well within the free trail period! Now I have to jump through all the hoops of trying to get my money refunded!!!
Primed Mind: #1 Mindset App,1224121850,Relevant topics,5,I‚Äôm really noticing a change within myself after only 2-3 weeks of listening to these recordings. Topics are relevant for current world issues. Def 5 stars. Would rate it 6 stars if I could select multiple recordings to be played in the one session! Keep up the good work.

Primed Mind: #1 Mindset App,1224121850,"Stop looking, this the app your looking for",5,"Looking for that app for self improvement, motivation, make a change, help learn about yourself and have it work amazingly. This is it. Been a pro member for a few months now. Had and tried all the other recommended apps but this is one I continue to use multiple times a day. Why - because it is helping me reach my goals and I want to keep using it. It's different and it works."

Deepstash: Smarter Every Day!,1445023295,Canceled my account and still got charged,1,Don‚Äôt sign up for this. The content is basic and mediocre. Once you give them your account details they will charge you even if you cancel before the free trial ends!
Deepstash: Smarter Every Day!,1445023295,Great neurodivergent resource,5,Really enjoy the snippets of learning in this app. Great way to get info without having to trawl through loads of information
Deepstash: Smarter Every Day!,1445023295,BEWARE No renewal reminders,1,No renewal reminders sent and they took $100 and then wouldn‚Äôt refund me back after I cancelled my subscription. Would not recommend
Deepstash: Smarter Every Day!,1445023295,Appalling service! DO NOT SIGN UP FOR DEEPSTASH!!,1,"I signed up for a free trial and canceled it before the trial ended, but they still charged my card $100. That was two months ago, and I still haven‚Äôt received a refund.  I‚Äôve had to follow up multiple times, and Deepstash keeps avoiding responsibility - like asking me to speak with Apple, even though I‚Äôve already told them Apple couldn‚Äôt help. Every time I respond, I hear nothing for weeks until I reach out again. It feels like they‚Äôre just hoping I‚Äôll give up and let them keep my money.  This isn‚Äôt just appalling customer service - it‚Äôs a scam. I‚Äôm far from the only one this has happened to - with a quick Google, you‚Äôll find other users complaining about the same thing.  DO NOT sign up for the trial. If you cancel they will still take your money and ignore you when you try to get it back. Save yourself the hassle and avoid this app altogether.   And if you‚Äôre reading this, please report them - it‚Äôs the only way to stop shady business practices like this."
Deepstash: Smarter Every Day!,1445023295,You‚Äôll learn nothing,2,"It has the veneer of education but is really just over simplification. You learn complicated topics in dot point format that make you feel very clever but in actuality, you‚Äôre just getting a surface level understanding of a real area of study that you‚Äôre now cosplaying as an intellectual in. And if you spent 5 minutes thinking about the concept, you‚Äôll actually realise that the dot points are just common sense anyway.  I do appreciate the purpose of the app, but it would be so much better if it encouraged critical thought, rather than just peddling the works of some the most underwhelming authors I‚Äôve ever seen and repackaging their stupidity into even worse summaries. Go back to doomscrolling, it‚Äôs genuinely more educational and less ideologically siloed than this app."

Study Bunny: Focus Timer,1478345385,Sigmer,3,Too many ads
Study Bunny: Focus Timer,1478345385,I love it,5,I thought it was going to be so bad but it‚Äôs turned out it‚Äôs amazing I use it whenever I do homework and I feel so proud
Study Bunny: Focus Timer,1478345385,Ads,3,It‚Äôs a nice app but there‚Äôs a lot of adds that are quite long. It‚Äôs still good though but a bit annoying when you enter the app again to see how long is left in your timer (I only have one device for both studying and study app tracker) and then I have to wait a while for a long add to finish before looking which waste a bit of time.
Study Bunny: Focus Timer,1478345385,too many adds but still good,3,"its a good app for keeping you on track but there are SO many adds every time you open the app or finish a task there is an add, some being 15 seconds it‚Äôs so frustrating. otherwise i love it"
Study Bunny: Focus Timer,1478345385,Way too many ads,1,I really like this app as it motivates me to get my work done. Something that really annoys me is that everytime i leave the app and go back on it there are constantly ads playing. There are other more efficient apps you can find!
Werble: Photo & Video Animator,966009633,Great app,5,"Awesome great wonderful video making app..lots of great effects some for free and others need to pay..which is ok for me now,at first I didn‚Äôt want ipto get paid effect ps but in the end I did and it was worth while..but please make more effects and make it for free too"
Werble: Photo & Video Animator,966009633,Outstanding app with exceptional developer support,5,"I tried quite a lot of image editing/animation apps before settling on Werble, which in my opinion is light years ahead of competing apps.  Firstly, the toolset available is incredibly versatile - dig a bit into the functions available for movement, masking, layering, you can get huge amount of creative mileage out of the tools.  Secondly, they have a working persistent support chat system built into the app itself for issues or suggestions with a very active support team (never seen such service in an iOS app and is better than most big companies will do) - it really is both exceptional support and exceptionally rare to see this.  Thirdly, the pricing is very fair for what you get - I really love the ‚Äúbuy what you need‚Äù approach, suits me perfectly to pay a few bucks for the fx I want and not pay for what I won‚Äôt use.  Forth, there‚Äôs an expert mode to unlock the ability to add as much complexity to your creations as your device can handle - which is brilliant, rather than being restricted to an arbitrary limit based on the oldest supported device out there.  They have really thought of everything from a UX side of things.  Big thanks to Alex and team for the great experience."
Werble: Photo & Video Animator,966009633,Beautiful ap,5,"I realy enjoy using this wonderful app. The team are awesome, who created this amazing functional creative app. Not only creaters  ready to listen they  are willing to try fix any problem big or small .  So thank you ."

Ultimate Weight Loss Hypnosis,514767232,Great meditation,5,I‚Äôve been using this app for a few weeks now but have followed Glen for a while. Love his work.

I will definitely download more!
Ultimate Weight Loss Hypnosis,514767232,Success!,5,Feeling much more centred and on top of things after using a couple of these hypnosis including weight loss and motivation.

Ultimate Weight Loss Hypnosis,514767232,Ultimate weight loss hypnosis,4,"I‚Äôve been using for a couple of months and have lost 5kg.

Way of Life - Habit Tracker,393159800,Love it,5,One of my favourite apps
Remente: Self Care & Wellbeing,961633456,Tired of paywalls before even using the app,1,"No ability to actually view what the app offers prior to having to create an account. Get around that, and straight into the subscribe screen. A free trial shouldn‚Äôt require payment details, until after the trial and I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs worth it. Unfortunate as I thought the app may be useful."
Remente: Self Care & Wellbeing,961633456,No support,1,I‚Äôve had the app for over a year and I got a new phone and they charged me twice and now I can‚Äôt even login to my account. Emailed 3 times and no reply. Very disappointing
Remente: Self Care & Wellbeing,961633456,Great app!,5,I‚Äôve searched for a free app that doesn‚Äôt have too many ‚Äúpay for a subscription to unlock everything but 1 feature‚Äù or ‚Äúfree trial then subscribe to use this app‚Äù.  Remente ticked that box and I‚Äôm very happy with how much I can do for free.  It‚Äôs super easy to use with a lot of extra sub-goals if you want to go more advanced.  It includes journaling which is also great.  Generally looks really nice which is motivating in itself.  Very happy I found this app!
Remente: Self Care & Wellbeing,961633456,Great app,5,"Just get the app, you know you want to"
Remente: Self Care & Wellbeing,961633456,Absolutely everything I‚Äôve been looking for,5,"Everyday for years and years, I‚Äôve been searching desperately for something like this app. It‚Äôs so easy to use and navigate. The goals are easily broken down into steps, so that it‚Äôs not too overwhelming. You can update your mood, and assess you life balance whenever you‚Äôd like - and look back on the changes, through a graph that‚Äôs made for you based on your mood and life assessment. There are general goal templates, specific goal templates, courses that you can learn about. I continue to find new features everyday that motivate me more and more. I‚Äôm absolutely in love with this app"
Ahead: Manage your emotions,1570430177,On the journey!,5,It‚Äôs early days but the app has been really enlightening so far. I love the gamification of my emotions!
Ahead: Manage your emotions,1570430177,Genuinely beneficial,5,This app walks you through the steps of understanding anxiety and provides really helpful tips
Ahead: Manage your emotions,1570430177,This is your sign,5,"This app has helped me so much, I‚Äôve learnt so much about tools for procrastination, anger and anxiety. I‚Äôm not healed yet because my journey is long but with a little help to mange my emotions I can notice my triggers and work through things. I hope this app can help someone else too"
Ahead: Manage your emotions,1570430177,Great,5,Amazing
Ahead: Manage your emotions,1570430177,Hopeless,1,"I signed up to try this App for a week. I thought I unsubscribed but missed the message that I would be charged for a year ($129.99) while I was travelling (from US to Aus, and offline). I asked for refund and declined. The option to discuss disappears.  I tried the App. I think it‚Äôs hopeless. Promises a lot, but offers nothing.   Beware of this money grabbing App.  Ironically promises to help with anxiety and treats used so badly it makes things worse."
Nearpod,523540409,Bad,1,This is sooooooooo bad and glitchy
Nearpod,523540409,Why u laughing,5,Very good fun time i enjoy very lot hahah so good
Nearpod,523540409,Good idea but iPhone App is clunky,3,Very good on iPhone when it works. Sometimes it pauses or skips or fails to start. Once that fixes I would like to use it more often.
Nearpod,523540409,School teachers perspective.,5,"Nearpod is the future of presentation tech which we have access to right now. This amazing tool empowers both the students and the educators. I use Nearpod in every lesson, across the middle year and senior year maths and science. Nearpod enables educators to create a blended teaching and learning environment;  it facilitates collaboration, peer teaching, gamification in an interactive framework. Ability to implement VR and AR, embed effective formative assessment strategies and provide timely feedback enhance student engagement. Reports provide useful insight to the educators which they can use to improve their classroom practice. Nearpod is definitely a game changer in education tech.   Nearpod impresses myself as it makes it possible to engage mostly disengage students in a category 1 school. Educators can design enriched, curriculum aligned high-quality learning adventure which makes a positive impact on student learning as it personalises, differentiate and embraces student voice and agency in a supported learning environment."
Nearpod,523540409,The app works well on a certain number of people,4,The app will work smoothly on a certain number of people but when there is to much people using the same code it will crash I would like it to be improved to cope with that.
Mytherapy medication reminder,662170995,Needs some improvement,3,"Medication reminder and inventory tracker work great if you mark your meds taken on the day they are due. If you forget to mark them, the inventory isn‚Äôt updated and you can only mark them taken one by one, not all that were due in that sitting."
Mytherapy medication reminder,662170995,Charge without using it,1,Just downloaded the app and it instantly charged me the premium without even having to use (even with limited functionality). An inappropriate app
Mytherapy medication reminder,662170995,Helpful,5,I wish it can be integrated with Apple Health.
Mytherapy medication reminder,662170995,Alarms not working,1,"Alarms aren‚Äôt playing for my app at all. No matter whether my phone is on silent or not. Literally the entire reason I have the app is to remember and track medication, so right now it‚Äôs not fit for purpose. There also should be an option to keep alarms audible, even when your phone is on silent."
Mytherapy medication reminder,662170995,Overall disappointed with the app.,1,"As a long-time user, I've appreciated your app's reliability. However, recent months have shown significant inconsistencies in notification delivery. A recent update resulted in a complete loss of my data, impacting my medication tracking and eroding my trust in the platform. ‚ÄîPreviously rated four stars, I'm now disappointed with the changes, including a user interface that detracts from the original experience. This is my first review, but the inability to track my medication has serious implications for my health. It's disheartening to see the quality of what was once a reliable tool diminish. I can no longer rely on the current version of the app."
Habit Tracker - Motivated,6472646551,Such a good app!,5,"I tested over 30 different habit apps, there are a lot on the market that are not good, to put it bluntly. Motivated is really well designed and easy to use, great stats and overall exactly what I wanted. I really like that there is an affordable one-off payment option. Really impressed by this app, I hope to use it for many years"
Habit Tracker - Motivated,6472646551,Best reminder app!,5,"Used to use iOS reminder app, but found this to be a far superior app. You can design your own program and see compliance trends.   Definitely worth the cost hands down. I use it everyday."
Habit Tracker - Motivated,6472646551,Wonderful UI,5,Nice clean ui. Easy to use.
Habit Tracker - Motivated,6472646551,Love this habit tracker!,5,Awesome app. Looking forward to an Apple Watch companion app and iCloud sync support.
Habit Tracker - Motivated,6472646551,Fantastic app,5,Clean UI and works as intended. Helping me track my habits easily. Would love Widgets to be added in future! Great app.
Saying When: How to quit drinking or cut down,881678936,The best app for alcohol tracking,5,"I've been trying many other apps from all around the world but this is the one that works the best for me! Very helpful, easy to use and truly does help to cut down or to be much more aware of your drinking..."
Saying When: How to quit drinking or cut down,881678936,Great app.,4,Really useful. Lets you keep track and gives you info on where you are compared to city wide average drinkers. Will certainly help you make changes if that's what you need to do.
Saying When: How to quit drinking or cut down,881678936,Such a well designed app!,5,Great to find a brilliant app that doesn't try to spam you or suck you into 'in app purchases '.  Wish there were more of these!
Saying When: How to quit drinking or cut down,881678936,Helpful,5,I suggest one improvement - daily reminders as to your goals.
Saying When: How to quit drinking or cut down,881678936,Ready,5,"So far, so good. Very helpful. You have to be ready for it. Thanks Canada :)"
Wellspent: Replace Scrolling,1643980844,Glitchy,1,I downloaded this app and went through the whole process of setting it up and I was super excited to use it!! But when I open the app it freezes and slows my phone down :(   The free trial is also confusing - I think I may be charged if I don‚Äôt delete my account but because the app keeps glitching and freezing I can‚Äôt delete the account
Wellspent: Replace Scrolling,1643980844,Good,5,Its good
Wellspent: Replace Scrolling,1643980844,Great app!,5,This helps me not spend a long time on my phone.
Wellspent: Replace Scrolling,1643980844,"Amazing app, but",3,"This app was amazing, gave its free trial and I loved it. The messages made me feel really happy and want to put my phone down. However, without paid version it‚Äôs simply not effective, and some people like me nag not be able to pay for it. Unfortunately, I had to discontinue my use of this service due to this. I do have a proposal, where perhaps a puzzle to wake up your brain could be added before you‚Äôre allowed to close the notification, which may be beneficial for taking breaks."
Wellspent: Replace Scrolling,1643980844,Wellspent review,5,Very nice. Love the idea of positive encouraging reminders.
The Zones of Regulation,610272864,In a world of fun,5,It gives me something to do and I love the avatars
The Zones of Regulation,610272864,No accessible for all,1,"The background music is just that, there is no option to have the words read aloud which makes it really inaccessible to children with disabilities (this is the main demographic who use zones of regulation)"
The Zones of Regulation,610272864,Great work,5,Wow best game ever do recommend love this so much
The Zones of Regulation,610272864,Disappointed,2,Not worth the extreme money charged. Lasted 10mins and game complete. I don‚Äôt mind paying good prices for quality apps but considering the quick completion I don‚Äôt feel the quality matched the price. Proceed with caution.
The Zones of Regulation,610272864,Makes Me Relaxed,3,This is a great game for kids with autism and other anger issues but the game lasts 15 minutes then your wonderful Zone of Regulation lesson is over but still it‚Äôs good in other ways!
Block Distracting Websites,1189844594,Only works for safari not apps,1,Disappointed that this only works for safari browsing and not actual apps
Block Distracting Websites,1189844594,One small change...,4,It‚Äôs pretty good. Simple and serves its purpose. One thing I would like is to be able to set the end date for a timer further forward (but not backward) while the timer is ongoing.
Block Distracting Websites,1189844594,Redundant,1,You‚Äôre able to block and unblock website in the settings on your phone. Meanings this app is completely redundant and a waste of money.   I downloaded expecting the same functionality as Self control on my Mac meaning I could block websites with a time limit before I can visits them again. Not an app that takes my money for something my phone can already do üò°
Block Distracting Websites,1189844594,Won't install,1,I payed full price for the apps but it wouldn't install!!!
Pomodoro Timer: Stay Focused,830466924,"Simple, effective and free!",5,üëçüëçüôåüòÅ
Pomodoro Timer: Stay Focused,830466924,Disappointing,1,"Hey there, I paid for a pro app years ago. Now to get any features I have to subscribe. But I already paid what you asked at the time. That‚Äôs a way to annoy your early supporters.  If I am a Pro subscriber, you should provide my updates free. You‚Äôll get your returns from others. Not happy."
Pomodoro Timer: Stay Focused,830466924,Great App,4,Thanks for a great app. Helps immensely to keep me on task. Would love to see an auto-reset button that can be used at any time.
Pomodoro Timer: Stay Focused,830466924,Don‚Äôt get the paid version,1,I thought this was better than the non paying version but no don‚Äôt pay for this app it‚Äôs suck
Pomodoro Timer: Stay Focused,830466924,Best timer,5,"This reminds me to get up from my desk for short breaks and then lunch break without having to reset anything. I love it. Easy to use, easy to set up. The best timer system I have ever got. Worth it completely"
F Muay Thai & kickboxing,1624463429,Awesome app,5,Fantastic coaching coupled with great user experience. I love training martial arts and this helps keep me fit and technique focused when I don‚Äôt have time to get to the gym.
F Muay Thai & kickboxing,1624463429,"Super useful techniques, nice app",5,"Very happy with the app, improved my sparring skills 100%"
F Muay Thai & kickboxing,1624463429,Can‚Äôt sign in,1,Can‚Äôt sign in unless you want to Sign in with Apple and two way authentication why can‚Äôt we sign in with email or a user name or with Facebook
F Muay Thai & kickboxing,1624463429,Amazing application to take your muay thai to next level,5,I love the muay thai combos provided in the app. Easy to follow. The application is easy to use as well. Highly recommended
F Muay Thai & kickboxing,1624463429,"Great App, Great way to practice",5,Awesome way to improve technique and practice combos!
Stay Focused - App Blocker,1658592224,Buggy,1,Doesn‚Äôt work. You set the block then restart the phone and it stops working rendering the app useless. Wasted my money
Stay Focused - App Blocker,1658592224,Horrible App - Don‚Äôt waste your time,1,"It doesn‚Äôt do the things it says it does, it is incredibly buggy and has technical problems, it has horrible UI and functionality, and it is completely utterly useless unless you pay for premium (the free version only allows one day of usage per week, and even that 1 day is very limited in what can be done)."
Stay Focused - App Blocker,1658592224,This app is horrible,1,"The amount of bugs and issues is unbelievable. Makes the app un-usable. The tech support is useless and has never fixed a single problem. The updates solve no bugs. I've paid for the full version, have been attempting to use it, and will be asking for a refund as it simply does not do half the things it promises it does. And when it does do them, they usually end up being so buggy that it's not worth it. It needs some serious programming changes."
Stay Focused - App Blocker,1658592224,"Free to download, functionally useless unless you pay",1,ONE day a week for the free version? Seriously? That‚Äôs evil.
Lucid Dreams Meditation,387517170,Great app,5,"I'm not sure how well it's working, but I do know I'm having the best sleeps I've had in a LOOOOOONG time. The relaxation induction is just amazing - and Ericks voice is appealing. Now crossing fingers it's working!"
Lucid Dreams Meditation,387517170,Nice app,5,Had this app for a few days now. No lucid dreaming yet but I do get a good sleep from it and have good dreams so time will tell :) still recommend this just for a good sleep app!!
Lucid Dreams Meditation,387517170,Good results so far,3,Will definitely keep using this
Lucid Dreams Meditation,387517170,Great,5,"Good job! Could include a few more details about hypnosis, such as is it as beneficial to listen to two different hypnosis programs on the same night?"
Lucid Dreams Meditation,387517170,Absolutely awesome,5,Really works. Very happy with it.
LiveMore: Growth & Leadership,1470901809,Ow ncie,5,I just downloaded it and it seemed amazing I can not wait to look on the app and try it out I‚Äôll get back to u when I checked it out
No Scroll - Screen Time Limits,6474079216,the best screen time app ever.,5,i've tried so many apps; but this one is the only screen time app ever which successfully stops you from doom scrolling. thank you so much to the developers!
"""No Distractions"" for YouTube",1482507016,GAME CHANGER. üòç,5,The best 1$ or two I have ever spent if you want to control how you spend your time this is for you. ü§ë  Step 1 delete the YouTube app ‚ùå  Step 2 install this plugin üî®  Step 3 use YouTube with out clickbate and üòÅwasted time from feeling bad to feeling great.
Run Your Time: Screen Time,6736434367,Like the idea,2,"I love the idea of this app, but it wasn‚Äôt syncing with my Fitbit properly and wasn‚Äôt picking up on workouts I‚Äôd done. I would definitely love using this app if it worked a little better syncing across apps. Great idea, needs better execution"
Run Your Time: Screen Time,6736434367,"Love the idea, app requires work",2,"App design is easy to use, idea is great, but the dates of my workouts are never correct and instead of expiring at midnight just keep rolling over. And adding to the next days total. Maybe because I‚Äôm in Australia so it‚Äôs having trouble with the format difference to the USA? Couldn‚Äôt figure out how to contact the developer to report this issue, will come back and update if it is fixed."
BlockerX Pro: App Blocker,6462085247,Piece if mind restored!,5,"If you can‚Äôt control your habit, or you just want to be free of an addiction, this is the perfect package that just ‚Äúworks‚Äù!  Honestly, I couldn‚Äôt be more relieved to have this protection."
