Amazing! I LOVE this app for helping me stay on task and focus through my easily distracted, ADHD brain! With how much this app helps me, I feel bad taking a star off, BUT (and Freedom devs, plz hear me out) the Schedule Lock feature could REALLY use a redesign by UX designer IMO. Between the Android app, and the website, there is confusing information on HOW it's supposed to function, and I wasn't sure if I was going to accidentally lock myself out of my Schedules or not. Otherwise it's gr8!"

this app is really making a difference in my adhd. ik they say there are different kinds, and at 47, I can say there are, but I happen to be both and an empath. I'm pieces which, in my case, it all matters. I'm a year of the horse GenX and a single mom of one who's 22 in college. I've been on medications, and I also use a site called TodayIsTheDay, and if it wasn't for Clarify( ADHD) and its sister app Fabulous, which brought me here, I'd be lost. These three platforms brought me to a better me
---
I'm not sure what kind of studies were done for this app, but I was immediately disinterested and distracted from WAY too many options/sections on Clarify. As someone who struggles IMMENSELY from crippling ADHD, this is not a help to me. Not only do I have to check in the app constantly, but I'd actually have to take the time to go thru my notifications in order to see anything I put to remember in the app. Hard pass.
---
this app helped me alot on my journey with Adhd
---
bruhhh this app is SO bad, i literally had to come here and say this. it took SOOOO LONG to set up the account, TOO MANY unnecessary questions, TOO MANY words on screen, TOO MANY pop ups. this app pissed me off so bad. This app is the opposite of what it says. it would probably make your adhd worse!
---
it's amazing until I can't see my previous notes on the previous task, also I can't continue the task I arranged before the day changed. I need to write my to-do list elsewhere before I put it here. this app just being my timer that tells me to put my focus on, give some insight and tips for ADHD, but won't keep your notes and tasks. I think it's not matter for some people, but if the developers do some improvement on this it would be really helpful
---
I desire that it were complimentary and included a version tailored for children, which could be overseen by parents, somehow interconnected for complimentary check-in sessions. As an individual grappling with depression and ADHD, and as a mother to daughters who similarly contend with ADHD, anxiety, depression, and separation-related trauma stemming from the abrupt removal from their primary caregiver and hurtful remarks from their othe4 I comprehend the profound support.
---
This app actually does the opposite of what it says it does. It is just a bunch of cheerleader posts: ""Yay, you can do it; just stay focused!"" I'm pretty sure the developers don't even know what living with ADHD is like; basically, Do Not Disturb mode can do anything that this app does much better!!!
---
This is a nasty company with terrible customer service to the point that you will never get your money back. They are preying on people with ADHD. They won't give you a free trial; they'll just charge you immediately. Customer service will take so long to resolve your issue that the warranty for my refund from Google is now void. Don't trust them. This company stole my money back in 2019. If I knew they were the same company that made Fabulous I would never have trusted them with my information.

Beautiful graphics, soothing yet energizing music, short& sweet but extremely helpful sessions, plenty of things to help anyone, without overwhelming or regimented.

It feels like this company just purposefully scammed me because I am unable to get a refund now after asking to confirm if the subscription was cancelled, I honestly feel like they just used my ADHD against me and told me to take a hike when I asked for help. They don't care about us and I'll make sure to never use this product again by putting a sticky note on my desk. I'll also warn others rather seek actual professional help. If you have ADHD you not the target audience, you ARE the TARGET.
---
I don't know if the developers have ADHD or experience of it, but the first few minutes of opening this app for the first time almost seem perfectly designed to antagonise and troll someone with ADHD. What a nightmare.

If you have ADHD or anything similar, I would highly recommend trying this app out. I believe that there is a free 7-day trial. This app has so many tools and resources available, so try them out!!! :)
